=== STATE BLOCK — GOALS, ACHIEVEMENTS, BLIND SPOTS ===
Date: 2026-08-08
Status: Working prototype, git repo (github.com/jens-goes-mad/
        DIY-KORG-KRONOS-EDITOR, `main` branch) with a public Hugo/GitHub
        Pages docs site (jens-goes-mad.github.io/DIY-KORG-KRONOS-EDITOR)
        and CI building all 4 platform targets on every relevant push.
        Core file format (Set List names + params + instrument-name
        cross-reference, now including Font size/Transpose/Combi Timbre
        references) is reverse-engineered and wired into a real CHOC app
        with drag-and-drop open and two independent panes, each with its
        own dataset selector and a Setlist/Programs/Combis/Duplicates/
        Internals category navbar (Internals: read-only bank/chunk
        diagnostics -- which Program/Combi banks and top-level chunks a
        loaded dataset actually has, since a real backup can apparently be
        saved with only a subset of data included; surfaced a significant
        pre-existing gap while being built -- see Format Blind Spot #9)
        -- browse/filter Set Lists with drag-and-drop copy-over/insert-with-
        shift reordering (real byte-level writes to both a slot's SBK1
        params and its separate SDB1 name record, same-Set-List only for
        now; ctrl/cmd+click marks rows for a future bulk action, no action
        wired up yet -- see "Setlist reorder/copy-over + multi-select
        groundwork" under "ARCHITECTURE" below), editable
        Comment/Color/Volume fields (all three writing straight into a
        loaded file's own raw bytes, independently open per row, safely
        blocked from being opened on the same slot in both panes at once
        with a toast popup explaining why -- see "Setlist Color/Volume/
        Comment row editors" and "Setlist editor UI polish + cross-pane
        edit lock + toasts" under "ARCHITECTURE" below), and a read-only
        Program/Combi library with byte-exact duplicate detection -- see
        "PROGRAM/COMBI LIBRARY EDITOR" below. A save-to-disk building block
        now exists too (`PcgFile::save()`/`saveFileAs()`, no UI yet), and
        real-hardware validation of it is actively underway -- see "First
        real save-to-disk piece, plus real-hardware validation tooling"
        under "ARCHITECTURE" below, and App/UI Blind Spot #9. The Comment editor's Font
        size now drives a live wrap-preview (real per-size character-width ratios,
        confirmed 2026-08-07 to render "nearly identical" to a real Kronos at a
        ~600px textarea width) -- see "Comment editor: live Font-size wrap preview"
        under "ARCHITECTURE" below. A
        componentized frontend pattern (small, standalone, byte-level-
        tested UI pieces) and a matching backend decoder/encoder
        architecture are now the deliberate direction -- see "ARCHITECTURE:
        DECODER/ENCODER REFACTOR" below, currently the
        active thread of work.

--- GOAL ---

A cross-platform, cross-architecture editor for Korg Kronos `.PCG`/`.SNG`
backup files, built on CHOC (HTML/JS/CSS UI + native C++ bridge) -- same
stack choice as the sibling DIY-MIDI-METRONOME/EDITOR project, reused
rather than reinvented (same CMakeLists.txt structure, vendored
third_party/choc, fetchResource/bind wiring in main.cpp). Preferred
implementation language: C++.

First iteration scope, as originally given:
  1. Open a file, extract its Set List(s) to memory.
  2. Show all entries of the selected Set List; filter/search, copy/swap
     entries via drag and drop.
  3. A Norton-Commander-style dual pane to move/copy entries between
     Set Lists.

A sibling reference project (a running CHOC-based app + CI pipeline) was
mentioned early on as something the project owner would link in later for
conventions; not linked yet -- see Blind Spots.

--- THE FILE FORMAT (reverse-engineered; full byte-level detail in README.md) ---

The `.PCG`/`.SNG` container is chunked (RIFF/IFF-like, but big-endian, and
every chunk header is preceded by one still-unexplained 4-byte field).
`PCG1` (the whole file) has these top-level children:

  DIV1  -- small fixed table, not decoded
  SLS1  -- Set Lists (see below)
  PRG1  -- Programs: 20 sub-banks (MBK1/PBK1 tags, interleaved)
  CMB1  -- Combis: 14 sub-banks (CBK1 tags)
  DKT1  -- Drum Kits -- NOT explored
  WSQ1  -- Wave Sequences -- NOT explored
  GLB1  -- Global settings -- NOT explored
  DPI1  -- unidentified -- NOT explored

Set List names (`SLS1 > SLD1 > SDB1`): one `SDB1` chunk holds all 128 of
the unit's Set Lists. Header (count/numSetlists=128/bytesPerSetlist=3612)
followed by 128 blocks of 129 28-byte records each (1 name + 128 songs).
Record = `[4-byte marker][24-byte ASCII name]`. A marker value of
`28 0f 01 00` on the record right after a name flags "this is where the
128 songs start" -- names and markers otherwise look identical, so this is
the only way to find a Set List's boundary. Verified end to end: all 128
Set Lists extract correctly, including 5 real user-named ones with real
song titles.

Per-slot parameters (`SLS1 > STL1 > SBK1`, a sibling of SLD1 found only by
a *generic* chunk-tag scan, not a targeted SDB1-only search): same header
shape, 128 Set List blocks of a 40-byte header + 128 song records on a
542-byte stride. Confirmed record layout (all field offsets relative to
record start):

  +12  `4*(color-1) + type` (bits0-5 only!) -- type bit0 (1=Program, 0=Combi),
       color 1-based; bits6-7 of this SAME byte are Font size's low 2 bits
  +13  bank index (bits0-4 only!); bits5-7 of this SAME byte are
       Transpose's high 3 bits
  +14  program/combi number within that bank
  +15  Hold Time + 1
  +16  Volume, 0-127, no transform
  +17  Font size's high bit (bit4) + Transpose's low 3 bits (bits5-7);
       bit3 and bits0-2 still unexplained
  +18  Comment (free ASCII text, can contain literal \r\n, NUL-terminated)

  CONFIRMED (2026-08-01, via a properly isolated test file, test_1.PCG):
  Font size = 3 bits (0=S the true baseline, 1=XS, 2=M, 3=L, 4=XL) and
  Transpose = a 6-bit two's-complement value (-32..+31), each packed a
  few bits at a time across the two bytes noted above -- full derivation
  in docs/README.md §4.4. This was a real, actionable bug fix: Bank and
  Color were being read as the FULL byte (unmasked) until this was found,
  silently corrupted on any real slot that also had a non-default Font
  size/Transpose set -- fixed in PcgFile.cpp, masks now applied to all
  four fields.

Instrument-name cross-reference (`CMB1 > CBK1` for Combi, `PRG1 > MBK1`/
`PBK1` for Program): both use one shared record shape -- the same 12-byte
header again, then fixed-size records each starting with a 24-byte name
field 4 bytes in (space/NUL-padded, NOT NUL-terminated -- a full 24-char
name has no terminator at all). A slot's bank/number index directly into
`[bank][number]` of whichever list matches its type. Verified against
three independent ground-truth anchors the project owner gave directly
(not guessed): "Rolling in the Deep" (Combi, bank 7 = USER-A / record 9),
"Berlin Grand SW2 U.C." and "Rain Again" (Program, bank 0, records 0 and
127) -- all three matched exactly. Bank values outside the stored range
(>=20 for Program, >=14 for Combi) are real gaps, not bugs -- near-certainly
GM/GM2 references (fixed MIDI-spec content, not stored per-file); a
one-off bank-231/192 reference each looks like genuine data corruption in
that one slot rather than a parsing issue. Across a full real-ish test
file, 143/152 assigned slots resolved to a name; all 9 misses were
out-of-range, zero were in-range failures.

Deliberately NOT solved (see Blind Spots): the `used`/count header
field's meaning, SBK1 +17's bit3/bits0-2, the 4-byte chunk-header prefix
field, and exactly which of the 20 PRG1 banks maps to which *display
label* (the name lookup mechanism itself is confirmed; the specific
letter shown per bank index is a positional assumption modeled on the
project owner's given naming order, not independently verified the way
Combi's order was).

--- WHAT'S BUILT AND WORKING ---

  - `src/kronos/PcgFile.{h,cpp}`: parses SDB1 (names), SBK1 (Program/Combi/
    bank/number/Color/Hold Time/Volume/Comment per song), and CBK1/MBK1/
    PBK1 (real instrument names, cross-referenced into `Song::instrumentName`)
    per the layout above. `load(path)` and `loadFromMemory(bytes)` share
    one parsing path. Every optional chunk degrades gracefully (a file
    missing/mismatching SBK1 or the instrument banks still gets Set List
    names fine, just with emptier fields) rather than failing the whole load.
  - `src/bridge/EditorBridge.{h,cpp}`: holds loaded files keyed by a "pane"
    id ("A"/"B"). Exposes `openFile`(path, unused by the UI but kept for
    CLI/debug)/`openFileBytes`(base64, what the UI actually uses)/
    `listSetlists`/`getEntries`/`moveEntry`(swap within a Set List)/
    `copyEntry`(across panes/Set Lists, whole Song incl. all params)/
    `setComment`. Nothing is ever written back to disk -- everything is
    in-memory rearrangement only.
  - `frontend/`: two side-by-side panes (`pane.js`, one instance per side).
    Each pane is a drag-and-drop target (drop a `.PCG` file -> read via the
    browser's File API -> base64 -> `openFileBytes`; confirmed working by
    the project owner in the real app) with a Set List picker, filter/
    search, and a table of that Set List's 128 song slots showing Kronos's
    own 000-127 numbering, Type/Bank/Vol/Hold/Color columns, and the real
    instrument name as a subtitle under the slot's own label (shown
    always, even when identical to the label -- confirms the lookup found
    something). Dragging a row within a pane swaps two songs (all fields);
    dragging to a different pane/Set List copies the whole song across.
    Clicking a row's Song/Type cell expands an inline multiline Comment
    editor (monospace, grows to fit content past 10 rows); clicking # opens
    a 16-button Color editor (real Kronos colors); clicking Vol opens a
    0-127 slider. All three route through the SAME shared raw-bytes cache
    per row and can be open together on one row at once (see "Setlist
    Color/Volume/Comment row editors" under ARCHITECTURE below for why that
    matters). Color/Volume commit immediately (color on click, volume on
    slider release); Comment keeps its Apply button. If two panes point at
    the same dataset AND the same Set List, opening an editor on a slot
    already open in the other pane is blocked outright (a toast explains
    why) rather than risking one pane's write silently overwriting the
    other's -- see "Setlist editor UI polish + cross-pane edit lock +
    toasts" under ARCHITECTURE below. No typed-path/Open-button UI (removed
    per explicit request -- drag-and-drop is the only way in, though the
    bridge's path-based `openFile` still exists underneath).
  - `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: fake in-memory backend (mirrors the real
    API) so the UI can be exercised in a plain browser with no native
    build -- cannot exercise real file parsing (browsers have no
    filesystem access at all, which is the whole reason Choc's native
    bridge exists).
  - `frontend/components/kronos/setlist-comment.{js,css,test.html}` and its
    sibling `setlist-slot-params.{js,test.html}` (Color/Volume): the
    componentized codec pieces (see "ARCHITECTURE" below) -- built,
    self-tested standalone, AND wired into `pane.js` via a dynamic
    `import()` (see "Setlist Color/Volume/Comment row editors" below).
  - `docs/`: a public Hugo/GitHub Pages site
    (jens-goes-mad.github.io/DIY-KORG-KRONOS-EDITOR) alongside the format
    reference doc (`docs/README.md`, mirrored -- keep in sync by hand --
    into `docs/content/format/`). Also has an Overview page, a Building-
    the-app page, and an App Architecture & Components page.
  - Why drag-and-drop is the *only* open mechanism: a plain
    `<input type="file">` does trigger a real native NSOpenPanel inside the
    Choc-wrapped WKWebView, but the resulting sheet renders behind the app
    window instead of in front (a choc/WKWebView z-order quirk, root cause
    not isolated). Drag-and-drop sidesteps it entirely and is arguably the
    better design regardless -- it works identically on every platform,
    whereas recovering an absolute path from a WebView's file picker is
    inconsistent-to-impossible across WebKit/GTK-WebKit/WebView2. Tradeoff:
    base64-encoding a 50-70MB file in JS and shipping it through the
    bridge as one JSON string isn't fast -- fine for occasional loads, not
    a "reload on every drop" workflow.
  - Build: CMake, C++17, Debug (frontend/ read live off disk) vs Release
    (embedded via tools/embed_resources.py) split, mirroring
    DIY-MIDI-METRONOME/EDITOR's setup exactly. No MIDI/audio deps (no
    rtmidi) -- this tool only reads local files, no device I/O.

--- PROGRAM/COMBI LIBRARY EDITOR (planned, Phase 1 built) ---

Goal beyond just Set Lists: browse every Program/Combi directly, see where
each Program is actually used, find byte-exact duplicate Programs, and
eventually delete the unused ones and repoint Combis at a single kept
copy. That last part means writing to a real Kronos backup for the first
time ever in this project, based on a part of the format that isn't
reverse-engineered at all yet -- so the work was explicitly split into
three phases, only the first of which is built:

  - **Phase 1 (DONE)**: read-only. `PcgFile` gained `ProgramInfo`/
    `CombiInfo` (flat `[[{bank, number, name}]]` lists, populated from the
    same PRG1/CMB1 chunks the instrument-name cross-reference already
    walked) plus `programSetlistUsages(bank, number)` (every Program-type
    Set List slot referencing it) and `findDuplicatePrograms()` (groups of
    2+ Programs whose full ~4960-byte record hashes to the same FNV-1a
    value -- computed during parsing since the raw file bytes aren't kept
    around afterward). `EditorBridge` exposes `listPrograms`/`listCombis`/
    `getProgramUsage`/`findDuplicatePrograms`. `frontend/library.js` is a
    new top-level "Library" tab (alongside "Set Lists") with Programs/
    Combis/Duplicates sub-tabs, a Pane A/B source selector, filter/search,
    and click-to-expand usage info per Program -- read-only, no drag-and-
    drop, no delete/consolidate buttons (nothing to wire them to yet).
    Verified against the real 47.9MB sample: 2560 Programs / 1792 Combis
    (matches 20x128 / 14x128 exactly), the known "Berlin Grand SW2 U.C."
    anchor round-trips correctly, and 62 duplicate groups covering 500 of
    2560 Programs were found -- including real repeated content like
    "Snappy Clav" and "Kompton Clav" turning up twice each in different
    banks, a good sanity check.
  - Caveat found during Phase 1: **bank 0 / number 0 is also the all-zero
    byte value**, so `programSetlistUsages(0, 0)` massively over-counts --
    16,000+ "usages" on the real sample, because a Set List slot that was
    never actually assigned a Program still reads as bank 0/number 0.
    Every other bank/number spot-checked (e.g. bank 2/number 8, bank
    19/number 0) returns a small, correct-looking count. There's no known
    flag distinguishing "really assigned to 0/0" from "never touched" --
    documented in `PcgFile.h`, not fixed (no known fix without a new
    reverse-engineering lead, same as the other format blind spots below).
  - **Phase 2 (structure CONFIRMED, not wired into usage-counting yet)**:
    each Combi's 16 Timbres sit at a fixed 188-byte stride starting 4806
    bytes into the record; the first 3 bytes are Program number, a raw
    bank code, and a status byte (Off/Internal/External/Ex2 -- top 3
    bits). Confirmed via real Combi samples the project owner provided,
    cross-checked against an independent external reference
    (`DaBlick/PCG-Tools`, see `docs/references/`) -- see `docs/README.md`
    §6 for the full derivation, including a Combi that initially looked
    like a model gap but turned out to be the project owner's
    recollection of that Combi not matching what was actually saved.
    `PcgFile`'s `TimbreRef`/`CombiInfo::timbres` and `timbreBankName()`
    are built and smoke-tested; still TODO: wire this into real
    Combi-usage counting (today's `getProgramUsage` still explicitly
    flags `combiUsagesAvailable: false` rather than silently implying
    zero) -- deliberately not done yet since only 8 of the ~34 possible
    bank codes are confirmed, and a real "Combi refs" count would need
    every bank a user's file actually uses to resolve correctly.
  - **Phase 3 (not started, depends on Phase 2)**: actual deletion of
    unused duplicate Programs and repointing Combis at a kept copy -- the
    first real write-back to a `.PCG` file this project would ever do.
    Needs a dry-run/preview step and a strong recommendation to keep an
    untouched backup, since there's no way to run Korg's own file
    validator from here to confirm nothing broke.

--- ARCHITECTURE: DECODER/ENCODER REFACTOR (decided 2026-08-01, in progress) ---

A deliberate architectural direction, agreed with the project owner, for both the
frontend and backend, growing out of building `frontend/components/kronos/
setlist-comment.js` (Comment + Font size, see docs/content/components/index.md for the
full rationale):

  - **Frontend**: small, standalone UI pieces under `frontend/components/{kronos,
    generic}/`, each split into a pure codec (`decode(bytes) -> state` / `encode(bytes,
    state) -> newBytes`, no DOM), a component (owns the actual UI, operates only on
    `state`), and a standalone `.test.html` harness with real committed self-checks --
    no CHOC, no native build, just a static file server. `setlist-comment.js` is the
    first and so far only one built this way; a generic reusable envelope/ADSR editor
    (shared across every Kronos synth engine's envelope curves) was discussed as a strong
    future candidate given how much of the Kronos reuses the same ADSR-shaped UI.
  - **Backend (Program decoder BUILT 2026-08-01, verified zero-regression against the
    real 47.9MB file)**: `PcgFile` no longer discards the raw file bytes after parsing
    (`data_`, retained). `src/kronos/ProgramDecoder.{h,cpp}` is the first small,
    per-record decoder (mirrors the frontend pattern): `decodeProgramFields()` (raw
    Kronos fields) and `hashProgramRecord()` (our own derived bookkeeping) as separate
    functions, plus `PcgFile::decodeProgram(bank, number)` proving a record can be
    re-decoded on demand from the retained bytes, not just once at load. This also
    happens to be the cleanest fix for a staleness class of bug the project owner
    flagged before it was ever written: if a component/decoder holds a byte snapshot
    captured once and something else changes the underlying record in the meantime, a
    later write silently reverts that other change. With raw bytes as the *one* retained
    copy (not a byte snapshot plus a separate structured shadow copy), every decode
    always reads the current state -- there's nothing to go stale.
  - **Backend (Combi decoder BUILT 2026-08-01, same day, covered by
    `pcg_file_test`)**: `src/kronos/CombiDecoder.{h,cpp}` is the second per-record
    decoder, same shape as ProgramDecoder -- `decodeCombiFields()` returns raw Kronos
    fields (name) plus each Combi's 16 Timbre-to-Program references (`TimbreRef`, moved
    out of `PcgFile.cpp`'s old inline `collectCombiRecords()`/`readCombiTimbres()`/
    `decodeTimbreStatus()`, now dead code and removed). No `hash()` -- byte-exact
    duplicate detection was only ever requested for Programs. `PcgFile::decodeCombi(bank,
    number)` mirrors `decodeProgram()`, backed by a new `combiBankLocations_` (mirrors
    `programBankLocations_`). `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`'s synthetic fixture grew a CBK1
    bank to cover this: a direct `decodeCombiFields()` unit test (name-padding trim,
    truncated-record degrade), plus end-to-end `combis()`/`decodeCombi()` assertions
    through `PcgFile::loadFromMemory()`. `timbreBankName()`/`isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()`
    stayed in `PcgFile.cpp` rather than moving, since `PcgFile.cpp` itself calls them (in
    `combiUsagesForProgram()`/`combiUsageCounts()`), not just the decoder.
  - **Sequencing (explicit, small-iterations-first)**: Program decoder done, test
    infrastructure landed (Blind Spot #14), Combi decoder done, Set List slot raw-byte
    read/write done (2026-08-05, see "Setlist Color/Volume/Comment row editors" below) --
    unlike Program/Combi, this didn't need a new standalone `SetlistDecoder.{h,cpp}`:
    every SBK1 song record's byte offset is one deterministic formula off a single
    retained anchor (`sbkSongsStart_`), not a per-bank location table, so
    `PcgFile::songRecordBytes()`/`putSongRecordBytes()` just reuse the *existing*
    `readSlotParams()`/`readComment()` functions already living in `PcgFile.cpp`.
  - **Datasets: decoupling "loaded file" from "pane" (BUILT 2026-08-01, human-verified
    in the real app -- "works like a charm")**: the two-pane UI used to conflate two
    different things a user wants to do -- (1) rearrange entries between Set Lists
    *within the same backup* to build a new gig Set List, which needs both panes
    looking at the *same* loaded file so an edit in one is visible in the other, vs.
    (2) compare/merge two *different* backups side by side, which needs two genuinely
    independent files. The old model (`EditorBridge`'s `m_panes`, keyed by the
    frontend's own `paneId` string, one `PcgFile` per pane, 1:1) did neither correctly:
    dropping the same file onto both panes silently forked it into two unrelated
    in-memory copies. We agreed the fix: promote **dataset** (one loaded file) to a
    first-class concept, identified by an id `EditorBridge` mints itself on open
    (`m_datasets`, keyed by `int datasetId`, never a caller-supplied string), fully
    decoupled from which pane displays it.
    - `openFile`/`openFileBytes` no longer take a paneId -- they mint a new dataset
      every call and return `{datasetId, displayName, setlistCount}`. New
      `listDatasets()` (every open dataset, for any selector to populate itself) and
      `closeDataset(datasetId)` (frees one, a harmless no-op if already gone). Every
      other method (`getEntries`, `moveEntry`, `copyEntry`, `setComment`,
      `listPrograms`, `listCombis`, `getProgramUsage`, `findDuplicatePrograms`) renamed
      its paneId arg(s) to datasetId -- `copyEntry` needed **no logic change at all**,
      since it already had no same-id special case; pointing both panes at one dataset
      and dragging between them "just works" purely from this rename.
    - `datasetId` is a plain `int` (not a string) specifically to avoid a real footgun:
      `std::map<std::string, ...>` sorts "10" before "2" lexicographically, which would
      silently scramble selector option order past the ninth open dataset. Matches how
      `setlistIndex`/`songIndex` were already round-tripped as numbers through
      `<select>` values elsewhere in this codebase.
    - New `frontend/datasets.js` (no build step, plain script like every other
      `frontend/*.js` file): `refreshDatasets()`/`onDatasetsChanged(listener)` (a small
      pub/sub -- a listener fires immediately with whatever's cached, and again on
      every future refresh from *any* pane or Library, so a file dropped anywhere shows
      up as a selectable option everywhere) plus a shared `populateDatasetSelect()` DOM
      helper used identically by `pane.js` and `library.js` so neither duplicates it.
    - Both Set List panes and the Library view each got their own dataset-select
      dropdown (Library's replaced its old hardcoded "Pane A"/"Pane B" `<option>`s --
      the closest existing analog, but never actually generated from a registry).
      Dropping a file always creates a *new* dataset (never silently overwrites); a
      pane's own selector lets it switch to *any* already-open dataset, including one
      another pane opened. `app.js`'s `onDropEntry` now compares dataset identity (not
      pane identity) to decide reorder-vs-copy, and refreshes every pane whose
      `getCurrentDatasetId()` matches either side of the move/copy -- this is the
      concrete mechanism that makes "both panes on the same dataset" behave like one
      shared document.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js` mirrors the new shape (`datasets = {}` keyed by a local
      counter) so the no-native-build frontend dev path stays usable.
    - Verified: full app + `pcg_file_test` build clean, `ctest` passes (this refactor
      doesn't touch `PcgFile`/decoders at all), all JS syntax-checked, `datasets.js`'s
      actual pub/sub + selector-population logic passed a headless Node smoke test, and
      a live click-through in the real app confirmed multi-dataset open, switching, and
      shared-dataset drag/drop end to end -- "works like a charm."
    - Two issues surfaced during that click-through, deliberately left unfixed for now
      (see Blind Spots #17/#18) -- neither blocks using the feature.
  - **Per-pane category navbar (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: the top-level "Set Lists" vs
    "Library" split is gone -- each pane is now a shell with its own single dataset
    selector plus a category navbar (Setlist / Programs / Combis / Duplicates; Global
    later, once `GLB1` is ever parsed -- not added as a placeholder tab, since there's
    nothing behind it yet). Motivation: the old split meant you couldn't put a Setlist
    view and a Programs view side by side, or compare two datasets' Program banks
    directly -- exactly the kind of comparison the `explore/sqlite-patch-datastore`
    branch's physical-bank-placement work would want. Built by splitting both existing
    factories into peer content renderers plus a thin shell:
    - `frontend/pane.js`'s `createSetlistPanel()` -- the old `createPane()` body
      (table/filter/comment-editor/drag-drop), now reading which dataset to show via a
      `getDatasetId()` accessor instead of owning a dataset-select itself.
    - `frontend/library.js`'s `createLibraryPanels()` (renamed from `createLibrary()`)
      -- same idea: dropped its own dataset-select *and* its own internal
      Programs/Combis/Duplicates tab bar (that nav is now the shell's, so all four
      categories are true peers) -- exposes `showPanel(name)` for the shell to call
      instead of handling its own tab clicks.
    - `createPane()` (same entry point `app.js` already called) is now the shell:
      owns the one dataset-select + category nav, notifies both renderers via
      `onDatasetChanged()` on any dataset change (regardless of which category is
      currently visible, so switching back to a hidden one later still shows fresh
      data), and still returns `{ refreshEntries, getCurrentDatasetId }` unchanged --
      `app.js`'s `onDropEntry` needed zero changes.
    - **Deliberately deferred, per explicit agreement**: no drag-and-drop for
      Programs/Combis rows (the hard physical-bank-placement problem from the
      exploration branch -- Setlist row drag/copy is unaffected); Duplicates stays
      scoped to the pane's single selected dataset, no cross-dataset dedup yet.
    - No backend/bridge changes at all -- purely a frontend reorganization reusing
      already-tested render logic; `pcg_file_test`/`ctest` untouched and still passing.
  - **Chunk-based data flow for components (designed 2026-08-01, first real feature BUILT
    2026-08-05 for Setlist slots -- see below)**: two deliberately different tiers, not
    one architecture for everything --
    - *Bulk/list views* (Programs table, dedup, etc.) stay served by native decoders
      walking the whole retained buffer -- real efficiency win here (e.g.
      `findDuplicatePrograms()` hashes ~12.7MB across ~2560 records; genuinely faster
      native than doing the same in a WebView's JS engine, and avoids repeatedly
      shipping large data across the JS/native bridge for something already sitting in
      native memory).
    - *Detail/edit views* (Comment+Font-size today, more later) request the *specific
      raw byte chunk* they need (one record's bytes) via the bridge, and do their own
      decode/encode entirely in JS -- exactly `setlist-comment.js`'s existing pattern,
      generalized. Preserves the "test without building the native app" property
      specifically where it matters most: interactive UI a human iterates on.
    - **Why not a deferred edit overlay**: originally considered keeping the retained
      buffer strictly immutable and layering pending edits on top as a `{position ->
      new bytes}` overlay (for undo/redo, and to avoid touching canonical state).
      Rejected: overlay keys are position-based (bank/number), and any *reorder*
      operation (moving/swapping Programs, Combis, Set List entries -- already a core
      feature) would leave a stale overlay entry silently applying to whatever record
      now occupies that position instead of the one it was meant for. **Decided
      instead**: `encode()` writes back *immediately* into `data_` via a new bridge
      method, `putRecordBytes()` -- baking the edit directly into the bytes that any
      later reorder would move, rather than tracking it separately. Safe specifically
      because this app is single-threaded JS with exactly one user editing at a time --
      no concurrent-writer conflicts to resolve. Undo/redo stays achievable this way too
      (each `putRecordBytes()` call is a discrete, reversible operation -- keep old
      bytes alongside new in a history stack), just not built yet.
    - **`putRecordBytes()` must keep the structured cache in sync**: `Song.comment`/
      `Song.params.fontSize` etc. are cached fields, parsed once out of `data_` into
      `setlists_` at load time. A raw-byte-only write would leave them stale (Set List
      table keeps showing the old comment). Required behavior once built: (1) overwrite
      bytes in `data_`, (2) re-run the *existing* SBK1 decode on just the newly-written
      bytes, (3) update the corresponding `Song` in `setlists_` from that fresh decode --
      so the structured cache is always derived from canonical bytes right after a
      write, never hand-maintained separately. **Realized 2026-08-05** as
      `PcgFile::putSongRecordBytes()` -- see below, same three-step discipline, just for
      Setlist song records instead of Programs.
    - **Cross-pane refresh gap -- RESOLVED (2026-08-01), superseded by the Datasets
      refactor below**: the plan on this line used to be a narrow fix (a
      `getCurrentSetlistIndex()` pane accessor, `app.js` checking "is the other pane on
      the same Set List"). What actually got built is more general and solves the
      problem at its root instead: "loaded file" became its own first-class concept
      (a *dataset*) decoupled from "which pane shows it" -- see the Datasets subsection
      below. `onDropEntry` now refreshes every pane whose `getCurrentDatasetId()` matches
      either side of a move/copy, which handles "both panes on the same Set List" as one
      case of the more general "both panes on the same dataset."
  - **Streaming/mmap for raw bytes -- considered, not applicable to the current data
    path**: retaining the whole file in `data_` isn't a preference for "native heap over
    streaming" -- it's a consequence of how bytes actually arrive. The app's only wired
    file-opening mechanism (drag-and-drop) means the whole file is already fully
    materialized in memory multiple times (browser `File.arrayBuffer()`, a base64
    string shipped across the bridge, then decoded back to bytes) *before*
    `PcgFile::loadFromMemory` ever sees it -- there's no live socket/handle left to
    stream from by that point. `PcgFile::load(path)` (a plain `ifstream` read, not wired
    to any UI control -- dropped in favor of drag-and-drop specifically because of the
    NSOpenPanel-behind-the-window bug, see Blind Spots) is the one place a real
    seek/mmap-based reader would genuinely help. Worth revisiting *if* path-based
    opening ever becomes primary again (e.g. if that native-dialog bug gets fixed).
  - **No encoder yet beyond `setlist-comment.js`, deliberately**: every current
    Program/Combi use case (table population, dedup) is read-only. An encoder gets
    built once there's an actual write feature driving its real shape, same "don't
    build for hypothetical future needs" principle already applied elsewhere in this
    project. **Renaming Programs/Combis/Set Lists** was explicitly named as a likely
    upcoming feature that would need one -- not started.
  - **Open/Save dialog**: real write-back (`putRecordBytes()`, and eventually saving to
    disk) will need either a working native Save dialog (the NSOpenPanel-behind-the-
    window bug, unresolved, see Blind Spots) or some other path-recovery mechanism --
    drag-and-drop is input-only, it can't hand back a path to save *to*. Explicitly
    deferred: this project is still in read-only territory (Phase 1/2 of the Library
    Editor, no Program/Combi/Set-List encoder exists yet either), so fixing this now
    would be solving a problem too early.
  - **Setlist Color/Volume/Comment row editors (BUILT 2026-08-05)**: per-column click
    routing on a Set List row (# -> Color, Vol -> Volume, Song/Type -> Comment, same
    fallback as before), all three independently toggleable so several can be open on
    the SAME row at once (explicit request) -- this is what turned "Comment still writes
    via the old struct-only path" from a style inconsistency into a real data-loss bug:
    with Color/Volume writing raw bytes and Comment only mutating `Setlist::songs[i]
    .comment` in memory, whichever committed second would silently discard the other
    (a raw-byte write re-derives every decoded field, including comment, from the bytes
    it just wrote). Fix: Comment was retrofitted onto the same raw-byte path, so all
    three editors on a row share one raw-bytes cache and one write path.
    - Backend: `PcgFile` retains one anchor per Set List (`sbkSongsStart_`, set during
      the existing SBK1 parse loop, no new scan) plus `songRecordBytes(setlistIndex,
      songIndex)` / `putSongRecordBytes(...)` -- the latter writes into `data_`, then
      re-derives `Song::params`/`comment` via the *existing* `readSlotParams()`/
      `readComment()`, same "cached field must never go stale after a direct write"
      discipline as `copyProgramFrom()`. Does NOT re-resolve `instrumentName` -- none of
      these three editors touch bank/number, so it stays valid; would need revisiting if
      a future editor ever did.
    - Bridge: `getSongRecordBytes`/`putSongRecordBytes` (array-of-numbers over the
      bridge, same `choc::value::createArray`/`addArrayElement` pattern every other
      array-returning method already uses -- 542 bytes needs no base64). `setComment` is
      unused by the new UI now but left in place in case anything else still calls it.
    - Frontend: new sibling codec `frontend/components/kronos/setlist-slot-params.js`
      (`decodeSlotColor`/`encodeSlotColor`/`decodeSlotVolume`/`encodeSlotVolume`) next to
      `setlist-comment.js`, same masked-read-modify-write discipline (Color shares byte
      +12 with isProgram/Font size, masked to bits2-5 only; Volume is a clean unpacked
      byte at +16, no masking needed) -- own `.test.html`/`.test.js`, reusing
      `test-fixtures.js`'s real "Rolling in the Deep" record (byte+12=`0xc0` confirms
      Color=1/Standard, byte+16=`0x7f` confirms Volume=127 on that real record).
      `pane.js` loads both codecs via a cached dynamic `import()` expression -- works
      from inside a plain (non-`type="module"`) script without converting `index.html`'s
      scripts to ES modules.
    - `pane.js`'s expand-state grew from `Set<songIndex>` to `Map<songIndex,
      Set<"comment"|"color"|"volume">>`, plus a `Map<songIndex, Uint8Array>` raw-bytes
      cache shared by every editor open on that row (`getSlotBytes()` fetches once,
      `commitSlotBytes()` is the one write path all three editors call through). Color
      commits on click, Volume commits on the slider's `change` event specifically (not
      `input`) so it writes once on release/blur, not once per pixel of drag.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js` gained fake `getSongRecordBytes`/`putSongRecordBytes`,
      synthesizing a 542-byte buffer from a mock entry's own fields (`makeFakeSlotBytes()`)
      so mock/no-native-build mode can exercise the whole feature.
    - Verified: `pcg_file_test`/`ctest` extended (round-trip, byte-boundary/neighbor-
      record isolation, wrong-size/out-of-range rejection), deliberately broken then
      restored per this project's standard practice; full app + test target both build
      clean; every touched JS file `node --check`ed; the new codec's headless
      `.test.js` passes (22 checks) against the real fixture bytes. Initially NOT
      visually click-tested in a real browser (no browser-automation tool available in
      the environment this was built in -- a static-file-server mock-mode smoke test,
      asset/import-path resolution only, stood in instead) -- since then click-tested
      live by the project owner in the real app across several follow-up rounds (see
      below), with real bugs found and fixed that the static smoke test couldn't have
      caught.
  - **Setlist editor UI polish + cross-pane edit lock + toasts (BUILT 2026-08-05, same
    day, driven by live click-through feedback)**: several rounds of real-app testing
    against the row editors above surfaced concrete issues -- fixed in order:
    - **Row order**: editor rows now append in a fixed Color/Comment/Volume order,
      matching the columns' own left-to-right order (#, Song/Type, Vol) instead of the
      original Comment/Color/Volume order.
    - **Volume editor**: gained a "Volume" text label in front of the slider.
    - **Editor-row visual treatment**: a generic `.editor-row` class (added alongside
      each row's specific `comment-editor-row`/`color-editor-row`/`volume-editor-row`
      class, kept as unused-for-now per-type hooks) carries a shared 10px left padding
      and a `darkorange` 1px left border, so an open editor reads as a distinct
      "you're now editing" section instead of just another table row. Took two passes
      to land correctly: the left padding was initially silently overridden by Bulma's
      own `.table.is-narrow td{padding:.25em .5em}` rule, which -- having two classes
      plus an element in its selector -- out-specifies a plain `.editor-row td` (one
      class plus an element) regardless of stylesheet order; fixed by matching Bulma's
      own `.table.is-narrow` prefix in the override selector.
    - **`tr.is-selected` row highlight** (marks "this row has an editor open") recolored
      from Bulma's default green/teal to the same `darkorange`. Same specificity lesson
      hit twice: Bulma sets the `--bulma-table-row-active-background-color` custom
      property it reads on `.table` itself, not `:root` -- a `:root`-level override
      loses because a rule that directly matches an element always wins over an
      inherited value, regardless of source order or specificity. Landed on a simpler
      fix that sidesteps the whole custom-property indirection: a plain
      `background`/`color` declaration on `.table tr.is-selected` (two classes + a
      type selector) beats Bulma's own `.is-selected` (one class) outright.
    - **`.instrument-name` contrast**: the Combi/Program name shown under a Setlist
      row's label sets its own dim-gray `color` directly, which -- being a directly-set
      property -- doesn't inherit the selected row's white text regardless of the row's
      own color; needed its own `.table tr.is-selected .instrument-name{color:#000}`
      override to stay readable against the orange highlight.
    - **Slot color palette brightened** (`SETLIST_COLOR_HEX`, `pane.js`) -- the initial
      pass read as too dark/muted; all 16 values bumped ~28% brighter (Black/White
      handled separately so they stay sane), keeping the demo palette in
      `setlist-slot-params.test.html` in sync.
    - **Cross-pane edit-lock (the one genuinely severe bug this round)**: two panes can
      legitimately point at the SAME dataset AND the same Set List at once (a real,
      already-supported setup -- see the Datasets subsection above) -- if both opened an
      editor on the SAME slot, each pane's raw-bytes cache is its own independent copy,
      so whichever pane committed second would silently overwrite whatever the other
      had just written, unnoticed. Fixed with a module-level `openSlotEditors` map
      (`pane.js`, shared across both pane instances, keyed `datasetId:setlistIndex:
      songIndex` -> owning paneId): `toggleEditor()` now refuses to open a slot another
      pane already holds, and a `releaseAllSlotLocks()` helper drops every lock a pane
      owns whenever its `expandedTypes` gets cleared wholesale (Set List switch, dataset
      switch/close) so a lock never outlives the editor state it was protecting.
    - **Toast notifications** (`app.js`'s new `showToast()`): the cross-pane block above
      needed to actually be noticed -- the persistent bottom status bar is easy to miss
      or get overwritten before being read. A small (~15-line) hand-rolled transient
      popup, deliberately not a pulled-in library (see its own doc comment -- worth
      revisiting with something like Notyf/Toastify if toast usage ever grows beyond
      simple single-line messages), styled with Bulma's own semantic `--bulma-warning`/
      `-invert` color pair (the same background/text combination `.notification.
      is-warning` uses internally) rather than a one-off hand-picked color. One shared
      `#toastContainer` (`index.html`, fixed to the viewport) so toasts from either pane
      stack in the same place.
    - Verified: every touched JS file `node --check`ed, CSS brace-balance checked,
      backend build/`ctest` re-confirmed green (none of this round touches the backend).
      UI changes confirmed against real click-through by the project owner (this is what
      surfaced the padding-specificity and cross-pane-race issues above in the first
      place) rather than only the earlier static smoke test.
  - **Setlist editor panel: real accordion + Close button (BUILT 2026-08-06)**: the
    "several editor rows stacked under one slot" shape from the round above still read
    as three unrelated table rows (no title/chevron affordance) with no single way to
    close all of them -- re-clicking the same far-off column to collapse a section was
    exactly the same "counterintuitive" complaint the previous round was meant to fix,
    just moved one level down. Redesigned into a real accordion: ONE `<tr class=
    "editor-row">` per slot (`pane.js`'s `buildEditorRow()`), containing all three
    Color/Comment/Volume sections as collapsible items (chevron + title, title suffixed
    with a live value summary when collapsed -- "Color — Blue", "Volume — 100") plus one
    dedicated Close button (`closePanel()`) that's the only way to fully dismiss the
    panel. Column clicks and clicking a section's own header now both go through the
    same `openSection(entry, type)` -- ensure the panel is open (fetching bytes/codecs
    and the cross-pane lock on first open only), then toggle that one section, never
    closing the whole panel.
    - State split in two: `openPanels` (which slots show a panel at all) vs.
      `expandedSections` (which of an open panel's three items are individually
      expanded) -- collapsing every section no longer auto-closes the panel; only the
      Close button does, matching what was actually being asked for.
    - The Font size button bar (XS/S/M/L/XL) -- present in the original standalone
      `setlist-comment.js` component but never carried over when Comment editing moved
      into this accordion section -- was brought back inside the Comment section,
      above the textarea. Deliberately NOT immediate-apply like Color: Font size and
      Comment text are encoded together by the same `encodeSetlistComment()` call, and
      an immediate commit would trigger `commitSlotBytes()`'s `renderRows()`, which
      rebuilds the section from the just-written bytes -- silently discarding an
      unapplied Comment draft. Font size clicks instead update local pending state
      (exactly like the textarea's own draft) until Apply commits both together.
      `entry.fontSize` (already returned by the bridge, just never round-tripped
      through an edit before) is now kept in sync by `commitSlotBytes()`, and
      `mock_bridge.js`'s synthetic SBK1 bytes gained the matching bit-packing (byte+12
      bits6-7 / byte+17 bit4) so Font size survives a close/reopen in mock mode too.
    - Color's swatch grid also needed a fix here: `auto-fill`/`minmax(3.5em, ...)` was
      sized for the old full-width panel, and came up short once Color's content sat
      indented under an accordion header -- switched to a fixed 8-column grid (2 clean
      rows of 8, buttons just shrink to fit) instead of trying to re-tune the minmax.
    - Verified: every touched JS file `node --check`ed, CSS brace-balance checked,
      backend build/`ctest` re-confirmed green (frontend-only round).
  - **"Select: None/All/Invert" bank-filter control (BUILT 2026-08-06)**: a small
    reusable component, `library.js`'s `createSelectControlRow()`, sitting between the
    Filter input and the bank-filter buttons on both Programs and Combis (explicitly
    requested to work on both, not just one) -- bulk-mutates that category's bank-filter
    `Set` instead of requiring one click per bank. Takes getter functions
    (`getPresent`/`getFilterSet`), not the `Set`s directly: `load()` reassigns
    `programBankFilter`/`combiBankFilter` to a brand-new `Set` on every dataset load
    rather than mutating in place, so a plain captured reference taken once at setup
    time would silently go stale after the very first load. Wired up once per category
    (unlike the bank buttons themselves, these three have no per-bank state of their
    own to redraw). Invert only touches *present* banks -- absent ones have no button
    and nothing to toggle.
  - **First real save-to-disk piece, plus real-hardware validation tooling (BUILT
    2026-08-06)**: the "no save-back-to-file at all" blind spot (below) starts getting
    closed, driven by a concrete, immediate need -- checking every Setlist edit this
    project has built (Comment/Color/Volume/Font size) against an actual Kronos, not
    just this app's own reader. Deliberately minimal, matching this project's "build
    for a concrete need, not speculatively" rule:
    - `PcgFile::save(path, error)` -- writes the retained `data_` buffer straight to
      `path`, verbatim, no serialization step of its own. This is trivial specifically
      *because* every edit already lands directly in `data_` the moment it happens
      (`copyProgramFrom()`, `putSongRecordBytes()`) -- there's no separate in-memory
      model that would need re-flattening into file bytes first.
    - `EditorBridge::saveFileAs(datasetId, path)` -- the bridge counterpart, bound in
      `main.cpp`. No Save dialog UI yet (no native Save panel, no dirty-tracking, no
      keyboard shortcut) -- explicitly deferred until the write path is actually proven
      against real hardware; building a polished Save button before knowing whether the
      bytes it produces are even acceptable to a real Kronos would be solving the wrong
      problem first.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp` gained `testSaveRoundTrip()` -- save() then load() the
      result, confirm Set List count/name/Comment and Program count all match the
      pre-save state. Verified via this project's usual deliberate-break-then-restore
      (temporarily require one extra Set List post-round-trip, confirmed the check
      actually fails, restored).
    - **Two ways to drive a batch of test edits, both explicitly built to exercise the
      REAL production write path, not a parallel reimplementation** -- the whole point
      of this exercise is validating that PcgFile/EditorBridge/the JS codecs are
      correct, which a from-scratch script would only prove about itself:
      - `tools/generate_setlist_test_matrix.js` -- a devtools-console script (pasted
        into the real running app's WebView inspector, `enableDebugMode` already on in
        `main.cpp`) that drives `getSongRecordBytes`/`putSongRecordBytes`/`saveFileAs`
        plus the real `setlist-comment.js`/`setlist-slot-params.js` codecs via a cached
        dynamic `import()`, same technique `pane.js` already uses.
      - `tools/generate_setlist_test_matrix.cpp` -- a second, standalone CLI executable
        (new CMake target, same minimal dependency set as `pcg_file_test`: only
        `PcgFile.cpp`/`ProgramDecoder.cpp`/`CombiDecoder.cpp`, no CHOC/WebView) that
        takes one argument (an input file path) and writes `<name>-test<ext>` next to
        it -- faster to actually run (no need to launch the GUI app first). Its
        Comment/Font-size/Volume ENCODING is necessarily a third expression of the same
        confirmed byte layout (`PcgFile.cpp`'s masks are private to that translation
        unit by design, and this tool has no WebView to run the JS codecs in) -- kept
        deliberately byte-for-byte mirroring the JS codecs, with an explicit comment
        flagging that if the confirmed encoding for these fields ever changes, this
        needs to change with it.
    - Both generate the same fixed matrix into one Set List's slots 010-029 (source
      entry at slot 000 -- these constants are edit-in-place if a different setlist/slot
      layout is ever needed): slots 10-14 vary Font size only (XS/S/M/L/XL, ascending),
      15-19 vary Volume only (0/1/10/100/127), 20-24 vary both together (the same 5
      pairings combined) -- each slot's Comment states exactly which value(s) it's
      testing, so the result is legible directly on the Kronos's own screen without
      cross-referencing anything.
    - **Group 4 (slots 25-29, ADDED 2026-08-06)**: a word-wrap probe, prompted directly
      by `frontend/readme-screen.txt` -- an untracked file with specific, confident-
      sounding claims about the Kronos's screen resolution (800x600) and rendering font
      (Helvetica-family), with zero citation for either and a resolution that doesn't
      match what's commonly documented for the Kronos's actual TouchView display
      (800x480). Treated as exactly what this project's whole methodology exists to
      reject -- a plausible-looking guess -- and answered the same way every other
      confirmed byte offset in this project has been: check it for real, don't debate
      it. All 5 slots carry the SAME Comment (`"01 02 03 ... 80"`, sequential 2-digit
      tokens, only Font size varies) -- unambiguous to read off the hardware screen and
      report back exactly where each size wraps ("line 1 ends at 09, line 2 at 19"),
      and directly comparable across sizes since the text itself never changes.
    - Verified end to end (not just "it compiles"): ran the CLI tool against a real
      minimal KORG-magic file, then independently re-decoded the output with a fresh
      Python script (not reusing any of this project's own code) -- confirmed all 20
      test slots' Font size/Volume/Comment bytes exactly match what was requested, and
      that the source slot and every other untouched slot in the file were unaffected.
    - **CONFIRMED on real hardware, 2026-08-06**: the generated file loaded onto a real
      Kronos with no issues at all -- meaningful beyond just this test, since it's the
      first real evidence that `PcgFile::save()`'s naive verbatim `data_` dump is
      actually accepted by the hardware, not just by this app's own reader. (Only
      tested so far against a minimal SDB1/SBK1-only file, not a full real backup with
      its original PRG1/CMB1/etc. content intact -- worth confirming that case too
      before trusting this broadly, see App/UI Blind Spot #9.) Every slot 010-024 read back
      exactly as written. Group 4's wrap points, read directly off the screen (each
      line's last token number, project owner's own report, one typo corrected in a
      follow-up): every Font size wraps at a perfectly constant tokens-per-line count,
      no exceptions across any line --
        XS=40, S=35, M=30, L=19, XL=8 (tokens of the probe's `"NN "` shape, 3 chars
        each, per line).
      Notably non-linear in a structured way: XS->S->M step by exactly -5 each time,
      then M->L->XL step by exactly -11 each time -- consistent with real integer
      pixel-width quantization (line pixel width / per-character pixel width, floored)
      rather than a simple linear formula, which is exactly the kind of texture real
      hardware measurements produce and a fabricated guess (see `readme-screen.txt`
      above) would not. This single-token-shape result doesn't by itself prove general
      proportional-font behavior (a real sentence's varying word lengths could still
      wrap differently) or reveal the actual screen resolution/font -- both remain
      unconfirmed; a longer single unbreakable "word" per size would be the natural next
      probe if that's ever needed for an in-app wrap-preview feature.
  - **Color names/hex CORRECTED against real hardware, 2026-08-06** -- both the
    biggest and most useful result from this whole test-matrix exercise so far. Added
    Group 5 (slots 030-045, `tools/generate_setlist_test_matrix.{js,cpp}`) writing one
    real Kronos color per slot 1-16, Comment stating which. Real-hardware result: the
    byte encoding itself was already correct (color N reliably showed as the Nth entry
    in the Kronos's own color list), but this project's working name list --
    `"Standard/Blue/Ivy/Gold/Rose/Azure/Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Cyan/Purple/Magenta/
    Brown/Black/White"`, an unconfirmed guess -- was substantially wrong, in both name
    AND order. The real palette is Korg's own curated, muted set, not generic named
    colors at all (no Red/Green/Blue/Black/White exist as such):
      1=Default, 2=Charcoal, 3=Brick, 4=Burgundy, 5=Ivy, 6=Olive, 7=Gold, 8=Cacao,
      9=Indigo, 10=Navy, 11=Rose, 12=Lavender, 13=Azure, 14=Denim, 15=Silver, 16=Slate
    -- with hex values the project owner read directly off the device (`#494c55`,
    `#282b31`, `#af4350`, `#661b27`, `#929a33`, `#233519`, `#aa8c3e`, `#723d3f`,
    `#3759bf`, `#0410ab`, `#9478c7`, `#745ad2`, `#5588c2`, `#385f9c`, `#546180`,
    `#2a3149`, respectively) -- not pixel-sampled, but close enough to use directly per
    explicit instruction ("treat as proposal," not substituted for a "usual" hex for a
    similarly-named CSS color, since the whole point is showing what THIS hardware
    actually renders). Full table now in `docs/README.md`/`docs/content/format/
    index.md` §4.5, the canonical confirmed-format record.
    - **Open question, explicitly flagged by the project owner, not yet investigated**:
      whether this palette (names and/or hex) is identical across every Kronos
      hardware variant/revision, or whether it differs by model (e.g. an original unit
      vs. a limited/"silver edition" unit) -- confirmed so far only on the one unit
      this project has access to. No way to resolve this without testing a second,
      different unit (or finding it in Korg's own documentation) -- noted rather than
      guessed at either way.
    - `frontend/pane.js`'s `SETLIST_COLOR_NAMES`/`SETLIST_COLOR_HEX` updated to the
      confirmed real values (replacing the guess), kept as the literal hardware value
      -- unmodified, not re-brightened -- so it stays a trustworthy reference. A new
      `brightenHex()` helper applies a purely cosmetic ~1.3x per-channel brightening
      at the one point these values actually get rendered (`setlistColorHex()`, used
      by the "#" cell background and the Color editor's 16 buttons) -- per explicit
      request for more on-screen legibility, without letting that cosmetic choice
      contaminate the confirmed-value record itself. `setlist-slot-params.test.html`'s
      demo palette and both test-matrix tools' color-name labels updated to match.
    - Verified: full rebuild + `ctest` green; re-ran the CLI tool against a fresh
      minimal file and independently re-decoded the output (same Python cross-check
      approach as every other group) -- all 16 Group 5 slots' Color bytes and Comment
      labels match exactly, source slot and neighboring groups' slots unaffected.
  - **Comment editor: live Font-size wrap preview, CONFIRMED against real hardware
    2026-08-07** -- puts the Group 4 word-wrap data (tokens/line per Font size) to
    direct use in the UI, not just as a recorded fact. `pane.js`'s Comment textarea
    now scales its own `font-size` to match whichever Font size is selected (live,
    before Apply, same as the pending-state pattern the rest of that section already
    uses), so what the textarea shows approximates what the real device would show.
    - `commentEditorFontSizePx(fontSize, containerWidthPx)`: the confirmed tokens/line
      ratios (XS=40, S=35, M=30, L=19, XL=8) expressed as a font-size scale factor
      relative to S (13px, the byte encoding's own true baseline) -- a RATIO, not an
      absolute pixels-per-line target, since this pane's width is user-resizable
      (unlike the Kronos's fixed physical screen) and no single "characters per line"
      could be correct at every window size. The ratio itself stays correct at any
      width; CSS text reflow handles the actual wrap for whatever width is currently
      available.
    - Width-responsive on top of that: the 13px-at-S baseline was specifically
      confirmed correct at a ~600px textarea width (`COMMENT_EDITOR_REFERENCE_WIDTH_PX`),
      so `commentEditorFontSizePx()` also scales by `currentWidth / 600` -- resizing
      the main window keeps the preview calibrated instead of freezing at whatever
      width happened to be current when a slot's editor was opened. Recomputed via a
      `ResizeObserver` -- deliberately watching the row's flex CONTAINER, not the
      textarea itself, since observing the textarea directly would create a feedback
      loop (changing its own font-size changes its own height, which would
      immediately re-trigger the same observer).
    - Font changed from the previous monospace stack to `Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
      -- a monospace preview would wrap real prose at visually wrong positions
      relative to the real device even with the right font-SIZE ratio applied, since
      every character would take equal width here but the Kronos's own rendering
      (like most real UIs) is proportional-width. Still an unconfirmed guess at the
      exact real font (see `frontend/readme-screen.txt`'s own unverified claims), just
      a more realistic approximation than fixed-width.
    - Incidental bug fix while in here: `autoSizeCommentEditor()`'s "never shrink
      below 10 rows" floor used to be measured ONCE (via a `requestAnimationFrame`
      callback) and cached in `textarea.minHeightPx` -- correct at the time Font size
      was still fixed, but stale the moment Font size became switchable (10 rows at
      XL is much taller than 10 rows at XS, and the cached floor wouldn't know that).
      Fixed by re-deriving the floor fresh on every call instead: resetting
      `style.height` to `"auto"` first falls back to the `<textarea rows=10>`
      attribute's own intrinsic sizing, which already correctly reflects whatever
      font-size is currently applied -- no cached value needed at all, and the old
      `requestAnimationFrame`/`minHeightPx` machinery was removed entirely.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js` gained a real test paragraph (`MOCK_WRAP_TEST_COMMENT`,
      the project owner's own real Set List comment text) planted on Setlist 000 /
      Song 000 -- that slot was otherwise blank in every mock dataset (index 0 has no
      entry in `mockSongsByList`, deliberately, so it doubles as an always-empty
      example elsewhere) -- so the live preview can be exercised in mock/browser mode
      without the real native app.
    - **CONFIRMED against real hardware**: at a Comment textarea width of ~600px, the
      project owner reported the preview renders "nearly identical" to the same text
      on a real Kronos. First real validation that a UI feature built directly from
      this project's own confirmed hardware measurements (not a fabricated guess like
      `readme-screen.txt`) actually looks right side by side with the real device.
    - **Dev-environment note, not a code bug**: mock-mode testing hit stale-cache
      confusion in Chrome twice this session (a change appearing to not apply at all)
      -- both times resolved by testing in Firefox or an incognito window instead.
      Python's `http.server` (used for the no-native-build dev loop) sends no
      `Cache-Control` headers at all, so a plain reload isn't reliable; worth
      defaulting to a private/incognito window (guaranteed empty cache) when a
      frontend-only change seems to not be taking effect, before assuming it's a
      real bug.
  - **"Internals" pane -- read-only bank/chunk diagnostics, BUILT 2026-08-07**: a
    5th per-pane category (alongside Setlist/Programs/Combis/Duplicates),
    prompted by a real concern -- the project owner can apparently choose which
    data gets included when saving a backup from a real Kronos, so a loaded
    dataset might genuinely be missing whole banks, with nothing in the existing
    UI to reveal that (the Programs/Combis tables would just look thinner, with
    no way to tell "fewer patches exist" from "a whole bank is gone"). Phase 1
    only -- explicitly scoped down from also letting a user INITIALIZE a missing
    bank/patch with default data, which needs its own dedicated work first (see
    "Deferred" below).
    - **A significant finding surfaced while building this, not before**: bank
      "index" throughout this ENTIRE codebase turns out to be nothing more than
      file-order position among however many PRG1/CBK1 sub-bank chunks were
      found -- not a confirmed bank identity. See Format Blind Spot #9 for the
      full explanation; this is a real gap in EVERY feature that labels a bank
      (Programs/Combis tables, Timbre cross-referencing, Program copy), not
      something specific to this new pane -- the Internals pane is just the
      first place that had to be honest about it in the UI itself, rather than
      silently assuming position-equals-identity like everything before it.
    - Backend: `PcgFile::topLevelChunkTags()` (a new, simple non-recursive walk
      of PCG1's immediate children, reusing the existing `readChunk()` helper --
      this project never previously needed to ask "which top-level chunks exist
      at all," only "where's the ONE I already know how to parse"),
      `programBankInfo()`/`combiBankInfo()` (richer siblings of
      `programBankTypes()`, adding record count/stride, derived from the same
      already-retained `programBankLocations_`/`combiBankLocations_` -- no new
      parsing). All three carry doc comments spelling out the file-order-vs-
      identity caveat directly, not just in STATE.md.
    - Bridge: `EditorBridge::getDatasetInternals(datasetId)` bundles all three
      into one response, bound in `main.cpp`.
    - Frontend: new `frontend/internals.js` (`createInternalsPanel()`), a peer
      content renderer to `library.js`/`pane.js`'s `createSetlistPanel()` --
      same "read datasetId via a getter, own no dataset-select" contract as
      both. Loaded AFTER `pane.js` in `index.html` specifically so it can
      reference `PROGRAM_BANK_NAMES`/`COMBI_BANK_NAMES`/`NO_DATASET_MESSAGE`
      directly (classic `<script>` tags share one top-level `let`/`const`
      scope -- the same thing `app.js` already relies on to call `pane.js`'s
      `kronosNumber()`/`formatBankNumber()` with no import). First built as a
      flat pair of static tables; reshaped the same day after the project
      owner pointed out it wasn't following this project's own component-
      reuse architecture (Setlist/library.js already establish an Entry-row +
      `.editor-row` expand/collapse shape). Now: one Entry row per Topic
      ("Top-level chunks" / "Program banks (PRG1)" / "Combi banks (CMB1)"),
      each with a one-line summary ("N of M found"); clicking a topic toggles
      an `.editor-row` directly below it (several topics can be open at
      once, the same "independently toggleable" model a Setlist row's own
      Color/Comment/Volume sections use) holding that topic's detail --
      chunk badges (struck-through if missing), or (Program/Combi banks,
      reshaped again the same day, see below) a bank button grid. Each
      topic's detail is wrapped the same way a multi-section accordion
      would be, so a second section (e.g. an "Initialize bank" action once
      Phase 1.5 has real ground truth) can be added to a topic later
      without restructuring. The file-order caveat is still shown directly
      in the pane, and the "N of 20/14 expected banks found" summary still
      deliberately stops short of naming which specific bank(s) are
      missing (see the finding above).
    - **Bank detail reshaped a second time, same day**: from a table (name/
      Present-or-Missing/type/record-count columns) to the exact same
      bank-filter-button grid Programs/Combis already use
      (`library.js`'s `renderBankFilterRow()`: `.bank-filter-row` CSS
      grid, `.button.is-small.bank-filter-button`, "Bank (Engine)" caption
      when an engine type is known) -- reusing that look wholesale rather
      than a bespoke table, per direct request. Semantics differ from the
      real filter buttons on purpose, since this isn't a filter: **Present
      = deactivated** (`disabled`, plain -- nothing to do, the bank
      already has data) vs **Missing = enabled** (`is-warning`, a real
      clickable button) as a preview of a future "click to initialize this
      bank" action -- NOT YET implemented (Phase 1.5, still blocked on
      real Init-Program bytes), so today's click just calls the app's
      existing `showToast()` ("Initializing ... isn't built yet -- see
      STATE.md") rather than doing nothing silently or pretending to work.
      Buttons are grouped into 4 rows via `internals.js`'s new
      `bankNameRows()` (a small regex split, not new bridge/backend data):
      I-* (INT letter banks), the lone G(d) bank, U-* (single-letter USER
      banks), U-** (double-letter USER banks) -- a row that's empty for a
      given category (Combis have no G(d), no double-letter USER banks,
      see `docs/README.md` §5.1/§5.2) is dropped rather than shown blank.
      Record counts/columns dropped entirely as part of the cleanup --
      the caption already carries what mattered (name + engine). Removed
      the now-dead `.internals-status-present`/`.internals-status-missing`
      CSS this replaced; no other new CSS needed beyond one thin
      `.internals-bank-groups` spacing rule, everything else reuses
      `.bank-filter-row`/`.bank-filter-button`/Bulma's `.is-warning` as-is.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js` gained a fake `getDatasetInternals` returning
      only 2 of 20 Program banks / 2 of 14 Combi banks and a partial
      top-level-chunk list on purpose, so the "N of M found" shortfall
      messaging has something real to exercise in mock mode too.
    - Verified: `pcg_file_test.cpp` extended (`topLevelChunkTags()`'s exact file
      order, `programBankInfo()`/`combiBankInfo()`'s record counts per the
      synthetic fixture), deliberately broken then restored per this project's
      standard practice; full app + test target build clean; every touched JS
      file `node --check`ed. Both same-day reshapes (Entry-row, then the
      bank-button-grid) re-verified all of the above (backend untouched by
      either) plus a CSS brace-balance check and a `curl` confirmation
      against the running static dev server that it was actually serving
      the new `internals.js`/`style.css`.
    - **Deferred, explicitly out of scope this round** (per direct agreement):
      initializing a missing bank/patch with default data. Writing a default
      patch into an EXISTING bank's already-present-but-unused slot is a
      same-class operation to `copyProgramFrom()` (a fixed-size in-place
      overwrite) and could follow once real "Init Program" byte data is pulled
      from the project owner's own Kronos, the same ground-truth-first approach
      as everything else this session -- not attempted yet since that reference
      data doesn't exist in this project yet. Creating an ENTIRELY MISSING bank
      (a new chunk that doesn't exist in the file at all) is a different, much
      riskier class of operation -- it would need to grow the file and update
      chunk-size fields up the whole hierarchy, and directly collides with
      several still-unconfirmed structural facts (the `used`/count header
      field's real meaning, the unexplained 4-byte chunk prefix, and the
      file-header checksum flag) -- explicitly agreed to treat as its own later,
      dedicated research phase, not bundled into this one.
  - **Combi-usage counting extended from 4 to 8 confirmed banks, 2026-08-08**:
    prompted by a direct question -- "why only INT-A..D, we have all banks
    identified" -- while explaining why Duplicates showed "n/a" for Combi
    references outside that range (blind spot #18 above). The two "identified"
    senses turned out to be different: bank *names* (file-order index ->
    "USER-D") are fully identified for all 20/14 banks (§5.2/§5.1); a Combi
    Timbre's own *raw bank code* -- a completely separate number space -- is
    independently confirmed for only 8 individual banks (docs/README.md §6.2:
    INT-A..D = 0..3, plus USER-A=17/USER-D=20/USER-F=22/USER-AA=24). Checking
    the code turned up a real, fixable gap: `timbreBankName()` already knew
    all 8 codes, but `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()` only covered 4 (INT-A..D,
    where the file-order index and raw code happen to coincide) -- the other 4
    confirmed codes existed but were never wired into the Combi-usage-counting
    path at all.
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.cpp`: replaced the three separate, easily-
      desynced encodings of this data (a switch in `timbreBankName()`, a
      range check in `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()`, and two ad hoc raw-
      code/file-order-index conflations in `combiUsagesForProgram()`/
      `combiUsageCounts()`) with one shared table, `kConfirmedTimbreBanks`
      (8 `{programBankIndex, rawBankCode, name}` rows), plus two small
      translation helpers (`confirmedTimbreCodeForProgramBank()`/
      `programBankForConfirmedTimbreCode()`, internal linkage, not in the
      header -- nothing outside this file needs the raw translation itself).
      `combiUsagesForProgram(bank, number)` now translates the file-order
      `bank` to its confirmed raw code before comparing against
      `TimbreRef::rawBankCode`, instead of assuming they're the same
      number (only true for INT-A..D); `combiUsageCounts()` translates the
      other direction. `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()`'s public signature/
      semantics are unchanged, so `EditorBridge.cpp` and the frontend
      needed no changes on the backend-boundary side.
    - `frontend/library.js`: found the *same* raw-code/file-order-index
      conflation independently re-implemented on the frontend, in
      `formatTimbreRef()` (the expanded Combi row's per-Timbre engine-
      type/Program-name lookup) -- its own `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()`
      mirror was a plain `bank <= 3` check applied directly to
      `t.rawBankCode`, and `getProgramBankType(t.rawBankCode)`/
      `programs.find(p => p.bank === t.rawBankCode ...)` both compared a
      raw Timbre code directly against file-order Program bank data. Fixed
      the same way as the backend: a mirrored `CONFIRMED_TIMBRE_BANKS`
      table plus `programBankForConfirmedTimbreCode()`, used throughout
      `formatTimbreRef()`. Every "INT-A..D so far" tooltip/note string in
      this file (Programs table's #CMB `n/a` tooltip, the Program usage
      panel's Combi-unavailable note, the expanded Combi row's own note,
      the new Duplicates button comment) updated to say "8 individually-
      verified banks (INT-A..D, USER-A/D/F/AA)" instead.
    - Verified: extended `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`'s synthetic CBK1 fixture
      with a second Timbre (raw code 20 = USER-D, file-order index 11 --
      deliberately one of the 4 newly-wired banks, not one of the original
      INT-A..D range, so the test actually exercises the translation
      rather than a case where it's a no-op) plus new assertions:
      `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank(11)` true, `(4)` (INT-E, unconfirmed)
      false, `combiUsagesForProgram(11, 7)` finds the synthetic reference,
      `combiUsagesForProgram(4, 7)` returns nothing rather than a guess,
      `combiUsageCounts()[11][7] == 1`. Deliberately broken (expected count
      2 instead of 1) then restored, confirming the test actually catches a
      real regression; full app + `pcg_file_test` build clean.
  - **Chunk header fixed to its real 12-byte shape, 2026-08-08 -- resolves
    this project's oldest open question, and the PRG1/CMB1/GLB1
    Internals-pane bug from the same day**: prompted by the project owner
    adding a large new folder of official Korg SysEx parameter
    documentation (`docs/external/KORG/`) and asking to cross-reference it
    against this project's own findings. `SetList.txt`'s per-field byte
    offsets, once compared precisely (a hand-arithmetic attempt got this
    wrong twice before switching to an actual script -- worth remembering:
    verify offset math by running it, not by reasoning through it), showed
    a *consistent* +4 discrepancy against every one of this project's own
    confirmed SBK1 field offsets. Separately,
    `docs/external/Synthify-Kronos-PCG-File-Structures.xlsx` -- already in
    this project's references, just not previously read for this detail --
    turned out to directly state the answer: "A Chunk has a header
    consisting of three 4-byte sized objects... TAG1... size... dwX...
    Data." This project's own model had the extra 4-byte field on the
    *wrong side* of the tag: not an ambiguous prefix sometimes appearing
    *before* the tag (the old `readChunk()`'s "try position 0, then
    position+4" logic), but a fixed, unambiguous third header word
    (`dwX`, meaning still unknown) always *after* `size` and *before*
    content. Every chunk's header is 12 bytes, full stop, no ambiguity.
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.cpp`: `readChunk()` rewritten around the real,
      unambiguous structure -- tag always at `pos`, `contentStart` always
      `pos+12` (was `p+8`, missing `dwX`), the old dual-position trial
      loop removed entirely. `collectChunks()`'s and `topLevelChunkTags()`'s
      own loop guards (`pos+8 <= end`) updated to `pos+12` to match.
    - **Same root cause as the PRG1/CMB1/GLB1 Internals-pane bug reported
      this session**: a `contentStart` computed 4 bytes short silently
      self-corrected often enough in a *deep, unscoped* recursive search
      (finding `MBK1`/`PBK1` anywhere in the file, regardless of exact
      boundaries) that it went unnoticed, but a *strict* top-level walk
      (`topLevelChunkTags()`) has zero tolerance for drift -- one short
      chunk desyncs every sibling after it. This is why Program/Combi bank
      data always displayed correctly while the Internals pane's chunk
      badges did not.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`: **the fixture itself was part of the
      problem** -- it built a flat sibling list (`SDB1`, `SBK1`, `PBK1`,
      ... all top-level, no nesting at all), which is not how a real file
      is shaped and never exercised the bug. Reshaped to the real
      hierarchy (`PCG1 > SLS1 > (SDB1, SBK1)`, `PCG1 > PRG1 > (PBK1,
      MBK1)`, `PCG1 > CMB1 > (CBK1)`, with a `DIV1` sibling first) --
      `appendChunk()` also gained the real `dwX` field (previously an
      8-byte tag+size-only header). `topLevelChunkTags()`'s own expected
      value updated from the old flat 5-tag list to the real 4 top-level
      tags (`DIV1`, `SLS1`, `PRG1`, `CMB1`) -- SDB1/SBK1/PBK1/MBK1/CBK1 are
      correctly nested now, not top-level.
    - **Verified two ways, not just "tests pass"**: (1) the reshaped
      fixture, decoded through the *old* buggy 8-byte-header math (a
      temporary revert), doesn't just fail one assertion -- it fails to
      load *at all* ("No SDB1 chunk found"), since the nested search never
      finds SDB1 inside SLS1's now-misaligned bounds. Confirms this was a
      real, load-bearing bug, not a cosmetic offset difference, and that
      the new fixture is a genuine regression test for it, not just a
      differently-shaped one. (2) The project owner's own "child sizes sum
      to the parent" description of the format was verified structurally:
      each wrapping chunk's declared `size` in the fixture is
      *constructed* as the exact byte-length of its children (via nested
      `appendChunk()` calls building up `sls1Content`/`prg1Content`/
      `cmb1Content` before wrapping each in its own chunk), and the whole
      file round-trips correctly end to end -- proving the parser
      correctly relies on that invariant, not just that the invariant is
      plausible.
    - Verified: deliberate-break-then-restore on the reshaped fixture
      (above); full `cmake --build build` (all three targets) clean;
      `ctest` clean.
  - **SECOND bug found the same day, immediately after attempting to
      commit the above**: the project owner interrupted a `commit and
      push` request -- "the app enters an infinity loop reading
      setlist_test_2.PCG" (a real 36MB file, located just outside the repo,
      first real-file access this project has had in this environment).
      This turned out to be exactly the right call: it caught a second,
      independent, more consequential bug the synthetic-only test suite
      could never have caught, because the synthetic fixture encoded the
      *same wrong assumption* on both the write and read side, so it could
      never disagree with itself.
    - **Root cause**: SDB1/SBK1/PBK1/MBK1/CBK1's own record-array header
      (the "count/numRecords/bytesPerRecord" 3-field, 12-byte shape this
      project had documented since early on) never actually existed as a
      3-field header -- it's 2 fields, 8 bytes (`numRecords`,
      `bytesPerRecord`), confirmed directly against the real 36MB file: at
      the corrected chunk-content boundary, SDB1's first 8 bytes read
      128/3612 (exactly the real numSetlists/bytesPerSetlist), and the
      real Set List name "Preload Set List" begins exactly 8 bytes in, not
      12. The old, wrong 3-field reading had been silently
      **canceling out** against the OTHER bug (the chunk-header fix above)
      the whole time: reading 4 bytes too early at the chunk level, then
      discarding an extra bogus 4-byte field at the record level, landed
      on the exact same real absolute byte position either way -- which is
      *why* real Set List names, Program names, and everything else this
      project had already verified against real data kept working despite
      neither individual assumption being correct. Fixing only the
      chunk-level bug broke that accidental cancellation and exposed this
      one. Confirmed via a battery of hand-written diagnostic probes
      against all 5 real `.PCG` files available locally (not committed,
      `.gitignore`'d, built ad hoc with `clang++` per this project's
      standard practice) -- after this fix: `programBankInfo()`=20 banks,
      `combiBankInfo()`=14 banks, `setlists()`=128, `programs()`=2,560,
      `combis()`=1,792, all exactly matching real physical maximums (before
      the fix: 4 banks, 6 banks, 0 setlists, 19,840/46,860 -- garbage,
      inflated by the same record-boundary corruption `collectChunks()`'s
      recursive-into-everything search was quietly absorbing). Load time
      for the 36MB file: ~3 seconds, not infinite -- the reported "infinite
      loop" was this corrupted, ever-growing false-positive chunk search,
      not a true non-terminating loop.
    - `topLevelChunkTags()` needed one more, separate fix on top: `PCG1`
      itself is a real chunk starting at byte 16 (its own declared size
      exactly spans the rest of the file, confirmed against real data),
      not implicitly consumed by the 16-byte file header as this project
      had assumed without ever checking -- `topLevelChunkTags()` now reads
      `PCG1` first and returns *its* children.
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.cpp`: all four record-array header readers
      (SDB1, SBK1, the PBK1/MBK1 program-bank loop, CBK1) changed from
      reading a discarded field + two more at `contentStart+4`/`+8` (with
      `recordsStart`/`setlistsStart` = `contentStart+12`) to reading two
      fields directly at `contentStart+0`/`+4` (`recordsStart`/
      `setlistsStart` = `contentStart+8`). A consistent, still-unexplained
      4 bytes are left over between the last record and each chunk's own
      declared end in every case checked -- flagged, not guessed at.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`: every synthetic bank/setlist header
      (`sdb1`, `sbk1`, `pbk1BankA`, `pbk1BankB`, `cbk1BankA`) had its
      bogus leading `pushU32BE` removed to match; `buildSyntheticPcgFile()`
      also gained a real `PCG1` wrapper around everything (previously
      `DIV1` sat directly at byte 16, which is not what a real file does).
      Deliberately broken (a wrong offset) then restored, confirming the
      test suite actually catches this class of bug now.
    - **Two more fixes landed the same round, from the project owner's own
      direct byte-level walkthrough of `SetList.txt`'s bit table** (not
      more cross-referencing guesswork -- explicit confirmation, field by
      field): (1) SBK1's Performance Type (byte +12) is genuinely 2 bits
      (`kSbkTypeMask = 0x03`), not the 1 bit this project originally
      decoded -- `isProgram` is now `(typeColor & 0x03) == 1`, correct for
      Program/Combi either way (bit 0 alone already distinguished those
      two) and no longer silently misreads the unused value 3 as Program;
      Song (value 2) still isn't separately represented anywhere in the
      app (nothing needs it yet), but the *read* is now correct rather
      than accidentally-right. (2) Comment is confirmed **512 bytes**, not
      524 (`kSbkRecordSize - 18`, this project's original assumption) --
      fixed in both `PcgFile.cpp`'s `readComment()`/`kSbkCommentMaxLength`
      and, critically, `frontend/components/kronos/setlist-comment.js`'s
      encoder, which previously both allowed writing up to 523 characters
      *and* zero-filled all the way to the record's own end (542) on every
      edit -- both of which would have clobbered the record's trailing 12
      bytes (of genuinely unknown purpose) on a sufficiently long comment.
      This was flagged as a real write-corruption risk earlier the same
      day and deliberately left unfixed pending exactly this kind of
      direct confirmation, per this project's standing rule.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`'s synthetic fixture also needed a related
      fix: `garbageBit1`, a parameter that deliberately poked byte +12's
      bit 1 to prove Color-decoding correctly ignores bits it doesn't own,
      no longer makes sense now that bit 1 is a real part of Type --
      removed (every bit of that byte is now owned by something real, so
      there's nothing left to garbage-test there). Deliberately broken
      (wrong Type comparison) then restored to confirm the test still
      catches a real regression.
    - `frontend/components/kronos/setlist-comment.test.js`: one assertion
      ("shortening the comment zero-fills the rest of the record") updated
      to check only through the real 512-byte comment boundary, not the
      full 542-byte record -- the trailing 12 bytes are deliberately left
      untouched now, not zeroed.
    - Verified end to end: full `cmake --build build` clean, `ctest`
      clean, the headless `setlist-comment.test.js` clean, and a final
      re-run of the ad hoc real-file probes against all 5 locally-available
      `.PCG` files (36MB and 9.3MB alike) confirming correct, fast
      (`<3.1s` for the 36MB file), sane results throughout.
    - **Explicitly deferred, per direct agreement**: now that raw-byte
      editing (Setlist Color/Volume/Comment, Program copy) is on solid
      ground again, reordering/swapping entries -- Setlist slots first,
      later Programs/Combis -- looks straightforward as a *fixed-size,
      in-place* operation (swap two records' raw bytes, update whichever
      reference bytes point at them), no file growth involved. Deliberately
      not started: the explicit agreement is to keep proving out "edit what
      we already have" (this round's fixes included) before taking on
      anything more complex, matching this project's existing "small
      iterations, no guessing" discipline rather than a scope change.
  - **Setlist reorder/copy-over + multi-select groundwork (2026-08-08, built)**:
    the "reordering/swapping entries" work flagged as deliberately deferred just
    above is now built, following an explicit RFC (agreed in full): dropping one
    Setlist row directly ON another is "copy over" (target becomes an exact copy
    of source -- name + params -- source unchanged, a genuine behavior CHANGE
    from the old swap-based `moveEntry()`); dropping BETWEEN two rows (or before
    the first / after the last) is "insert with shift" -- a pure rotation of the
    same 128 slots, safe by construction since nothing is added or removed.
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.h`/`.cpp`: new `nameRecordBytes()`/`putNameRecordBytes()`
      (the 28-byte SDB1 name record -- confirmed to live in a completely separate
      chunk/stride from a slot's SBK1 params, so any relocate/copy must move both
      together or the result mismatches a slot's displayed name against its
      actual content) and `reorderSong()` (relocates one slot's name AND params
      together within one Set List, shifting the intervening range by one -- one
      native call, not N bridge round-trips, matching this project's two-tier
      data-flow model for bulk operations). `moveEntry()` (the old same-Setlist
      swap, in-memory-struct-only, predating the real byte-level write path) is
      deleted, fully superseded.
    - `src/bridge/EditorBridge.h`/`.cpp`, `src/main.cpp`: `getNameRecordBytes()`/
      `putNameRecordBytes()`/`reorderSongEntry()` bound the same way as the
      existing Song-record pair; `copyEntry()` kept, now documented as cross-
      Set-List-only (same-Set-List dragging no longer uses it).
    - `frontend/pane.js`: `dropZoneForEvent()` reads a row's cursor Y-position
      (top/bottom 30% = insert before/after, middle = copy over) and drag
      handlers toggle `.drop-target` (the "copy over" full-row highlight,
      `background`/`outline` in `frontend/style.css`) for "on".
    - **Bug found during manual testing (2026-08-08), same day this landed**:
      the insert before/after gesture's visual feedback never actually
      rendered -- only "copy over" did. Root cause: the insert indicator was
      originally a `box-shadow` on the target `<tr>` itself
      (`.drop-target-before`/`.drop-target-after`), and Bulma's `.table` sets
      `border-collapse: collapse`, under which no current browser paints a
      `box-shadow` on a table row at all -- a real table-rendering
      limitation, not a specificity or z-index bug (confirmed by the "on"
      gesture working fine, since `background`/`outline` don't have this
      limitation). Fixed by replacing the `<tr>` box-shadow entirely with one
      floating `<div class="drop-indicator">` per Setlist panel, absolutely
      positioned against `.entries-scroll` (now `position: relative`) and
      moved via `showDropIndicator(tr, zone)`/`hideDropIndicator()` to
      straddle the boundary above/below the current insert target -- scrolls
      naturally with the table since it's a sibling inside the same
      scrolling element, and sidesteps table-layout quirks entirely rather
      than fighting them. `.multi-selected` (added the same day, see below)
      had the identical latent bug -- its own box-shadow was moved from the
      `<tr>` onto `tr.multi-selected > td:first-child` instead, since
      box-shadow on a `<td>` *does* render correctly under border-collapse
      (the standard workaround for this class of bug).
    - Ctrl/Cmd+click toggles a row into a `multiSelected` Set independent of
      `openPanels` (which rows have an editor open) -- styled via a new
      `.multi-selected` class (a left-edge inset box-shadow using a new
      `--multiselect-accent` token, deliberately additive rather than
      fighting `.is-selected`'s background or `.drop-target`'s outline for
      the same CSS property, since a row can carry any combination of the
      three states at once). Per direct agreement, multi-select has no
      further action wired to it yet ("2.X no further action right now" in
      the RFC) -- purely visual groundwork for a future bulk action.
    - `frontend/app.js`: `onDropEntry()` rewritten to dispatch on `zone`/
      `sameList` -- insert uses the one native `reorderSongEntry()` call; copy-
      over reads+writes both the params and name records (`Promise.all()` pairs)
      since they're separate SBK1/SDB1 records; cross-dataset stays blocked
      (unchanged reasoning, see the function's own doc comment) and cross-
      Set-List-same-dataset stays on the older in-memory-only `copyEntry()` --
      true cross-Set-List insert would have to evict something from an already-
      full 128-slot destination to make room, a real data-loss question still
      deliberately not tackled.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: `moveEntry()` fake removed; `reorderSongEntry()`
      fake mirrors the real splice-and-reindex semantics; `getNameRecordBytes()`/
      `putNameRecordBytes()` fakes synthesize/parse a 28-byte buffer from a mock
      entry's `label` field (mirroring the existing `makeFakeSlotBytes()` pattern
      for the 542-byte params record).
    - Backend verified: full `cmake --build build` clean, `ctest` clean
      (`PcgFile.cpp`'s `reorderSong()`/name-record methods have their own
      deliberate-break-then-restore coverage in `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`).
      Frontend verified: `node --check` on every touched file, CSS brace-balance
      checked, and confirmed working in the real app (2026-08-08, manual test
      against a real backup) -- copy-over and insert both write real bytes, as
      intended (see EditorBridge.h's own class doc comment for the one
      exception: cross-Set-List dragging still uses the older in-memory-only
      `copyEntry()`, and nothing is written to disk until an explicit
      `saveFileAs()` call).
  - **"Copy all to opposite" + swap-panes button (2026-08-08, built)**: further
    UI polish requested the same day, once the reorder/copy-over gestures above
    were confirmed working end to end.
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.h`/`.cpp`: new `copySetlist(srcSetlistIndex,
      dstSetlistIndex)` -- overwrites every one of a destination Set List's 128
      slots (both name and params records) with a source Set List's, reusing
      `nameRecordBytes()`/`songRecordBytes()`/`putNameRecordBytes()`/
      `putSongRecordBytes()` internally (same pattern as `reorderSong()`), one
      native call rather than 256 bridge round-trips. Same-file only (both
      indices are Set Lists within the one already-open `PcgFile`); leaves the
      destination Set List's own name (`Setlist::name`) untouched, only the
      song slots move. `src/bridge/EditorBridge.h`/`.cpp`, `src/main.cpp`:
      `copySetlistEntries(datasetId, srcSetlistIndex, dstSetlistIndex)` bound
      the same way as the other Setlist bridge methods.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`: the synthetic fixture gained a SECOND Set
      List ("Gig Setlist", one pre-existing song "Old Song") specifically so
      `copySetlist()`'s test can tell a real overwrite apart from a no-op --
      deliberately broken (skipped the params write) then restored, confirming
      the new test genuinely catches a regression, not just checking the happy
      path.
    - `frontend/pane.js`: the Setlist panel's "Showing ..." row (`.setlist-
      info-row`, `style.css`) gained a "Copy all to opposite" button, enabled
      only when this pane and the opposite pane share one dataset with two
      different Set Lists selected. Reading the OPPOSITE pane's current
      dataset/Set List needed a small addition: `datasets.js` gained
      `notifyPaneSelectionChanged()`/`onPaneSelectionChanged()`, a plain
      broadcast (deliberately no stored state of its own, unlike the datasets-
      list cache above it in the same file) that tells a pane WHEN to re-read
      its sibling's already-authoritative state (`getCurrentDatasetId()`, and
      a new `getCurrentSetlistIndex()` exposed the same way) -- fired whenever
      any pane's own dataset/Set List selection changes, whether or not that
      pane owns the button being recomputed.
    - `frontend/app.js`: `onCopySetlist(source, target)` (mirrors
      `onDropEntry`'s shape) calls the new bridge method and refreshes
      whichever pane(s) show the destination dataset. A new `swapPanes()`
      physically reorders the two `<section class="pane">` DOM elements
      inside `.panes` -- deliberately NOT a data/state swap, since a pane's
      `paneId` ("A"/"B") is only ever used as a label (status log prefixes,
      the cross-pane slot-edit lock), never to decide which side is which, so
      moving the element is sufficient.
    - `frontend/style.css`: the swap button is `position: absolute` against
      `.panes` (now `position: relative`), floating over the 1px seam between
      the two panes rather than being a real third flex item -- keeps both
      panes' widths exactly as Bulma's `.columns` grid already computes them.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: `copySetlistEntries()` fake added, same
      "overwrite dst's slots while keeping dst's own position/index" contract
      as the real bridge method.
  - **Drag-and-drop insert indicator bug found during the SAME manual test
    session (2026-08-08)**: copy-over (drop directly on a row) visibly
    worked; insert (drop between two rows) showed no feedback at all. Root
    cause: the insert indicator was a `box-shadow` on the target `<tr>`
    itself (`.drop-target-before`/`.drop-target-after`), and Bulma's
    `.table` sets `border-collapse: collapse` -- no current browser paints a
    `box-shadow` on a table row under `border-collapse` at all, a genuine
    table-rendering limitation, not a specificity or z-index bug (confirmed
    by copy-over working fine, since its `.drop-target` uses
    `background`/`outline` instead, neither of which has this limitation).
    Fixed by replacing the `<tr>` box-shadow entirely with one floating
    `<div class="drop-indicator">` per Setlist panel, absolutely positioned
    against `.entries-scroll` (now `position: relative`) and moved via
    `showDropIndicator(tr, zone)`/`hideDropIndicator()` (`frontend/pane.js`)
    to straddle the boundary above/below the current insert target --
    scrolls naturally with the table since it's a sibling inside the same
    scrolling element, sidestepping the table-layout limitation entirely
    rather than fighting it. The `.multi-selected` marker (added the same
    day) had the identical latent bug -- moved from the `<tr>` onto
    `tr.multi-selected > td:first-child` instead, since box-shadow on a
    `<td>` *does* render correctly under `border-collapse` (the standard
    workaround for this class of bug).
  - **Drag-and-drop code reuse assessed, not (yet) refactored (2026-08-08)**:
    asked whether the Setlist drag-and-drop code (`pane.js`) is shared with
    or reusable by Programs' own drag-and-drop (`library.js`, copy-a-Program-
    onto-another-slot). It isn't -- the two are independently hand-written,
    each with its own `dragstart`/`dragend`/`dragover`/`dragleave`/`drop`
    listener set, own `dataTransfer` JSON payload shape, and own accept/
    reject rules (Setlist's is genuinely more complex: 3 drop zones via
    `dropZoneForEvent()` plus the floating indicator above; Programs' is a
    single zone, engine-type-gated). A shared `frontend/dragdrop.js` helper
    extracting just the common listener-wiring boilerplate (JSON
    serialize/parse, `drop-target` class toggling, the `preventDefault`/
    `dropEffect` dance) is a real, low-risk option if this need comes up a
    third time -- explicitly not built now, per this project's "don't build
    for hypothetical future needs" rule: two call sites don't yet justify the
    abstraction, and the domain-specific parts (zone detection, accept
    rules, indicator positioning) would stay per-caller regardless, so the
    win is real but modest.
  - **A-Z/Z-A sort buttons, FIRST VERSION (2026-08-09, built, then corrected
    the same day -- see below)**: two buttons beside the filter input,
    `frontend/pane.js`, toggle-style (`.is-link`) -- sorted the visible rows
    by name ascending/descending, or back to physical slot order if the
    active one was clicked again. Built display-only, exactly like the
    existing filter: a `sortOrder` (`null`/`"asc"`/`"desc"`) applied in
    `renderRows()` on top of the filtered list, right before rendering --
    never touched `entries`/any entry's own `.index`. This turned out to be
    the wrong call (see the next entry) and has been fully replaced, not
    kept alongside the new behavior.
  - **Slot-position-IS-order confirmed directly against `docs/external/
    KORG/SetList.txt` (2026-08-09)**: Korg's own SysEx documentation lays
    out Slot 0 at a fixed record offset and states Slots 1-127 simply
    follow at the same stride, "and the IDX is assigned to 1 ~ 127" -- no
    separate order/pointer field exists anywhere in the structure. Added to
    `docs/README.md`/`docs/content/format/index.md` §3.2 as confirmed
    ground truth: a slot's number IS its physical record position, nothing
    else stores or could store it.
  - **Sort buttons corrected to a real reorder (2026-08-09, same day)**: the
    first version's reasoning was backwards. Since a slot's number IS its
    physical position (previous entry) and nothing else stores order, a
    *display-only* sort can't mean anything to a real Kronos -- it never
    even sees the app's UI state, only the file's bytes. The project owner
    caught this directly: "DAD and SORTING is NOT [display-only]. It has to
    change the underlying rawdata." Rebuilt accordingly:
    - `src/kronos/PcgFile.h`/`.cpp`: new `sortSetlist(setlistIndex,
      ascending)` -- computes the target alphabetical order for all 128
      slots (empty-named slots always trail last, regardless of direction,
      matching the old display convention), snapshots every slot's raw
      name+params bytes up front (unlike `reorderSong()`'s single-range
      shift, this touches all 128 slots in a non-contiguous new order, so
      there's no safe read-then-write direction without snapshotting
      first), then writes them back via the existing
      `putNameRecordBytes()`/`putSongRecordBytes()`. Comparison is a plain
      byte-wise `std::string` compare, not locale-aware -- fine for the
      ASCII-range names seen so far, flagged in the doc comment as a
      known simplification.
    - `src/bridge/EditorBridge.h`/`.cpp`, `src/main.cpp`:
      `sortSetlistEntries(datasetId, setlistIndex, ascending)` bound the
      same way as the other Setlist bridge methods; a small `boolArg()`
      helper added alongside the existing `stringArg()`/`intArg()`.
    - `frontend/pane.js`: the entire client-side `sortOrder`/in-`renderRows()`
      sort is gone. The two buttons now call `sortSetlistEntries()` and
      `refreshEntries()` (re-reading the file's now-actually-different
      physical order) -- a one-shot immediate action, not a toggleable view
      mode, so the `.is-link` active-state styling is gone too (nothing to
      indicate as "currently active" once there's no persistent mode).
      Button tooltips rewritten to say plainly: real bytes, immediate,
      whole Set List, no undo.
    - `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`: new `sortSetlist()` coverage on the
      existing 2-song fixture (ascending puts "Song One" before "Song
      Zero", empties trail; descending restores the original order, which
      doubles as the test's own cleanup) -- deliberately broken (flipped
      the empty-slots-trail-last comparison) then restored, confirming 8
      real assertions catch the regression.
    - `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: `sortSetlistEntries()` fake added (there
      was nothing to replace here -- the old display-only sort never called
      the bridge at all).
    - `docs/README.md`/`docs/content/format/index.md` §3.2, and the new
      Hugo User Guide's Setlist section, corrected to describe the sort
      buttons as a real, immediate, whole-Set-List rewrite -- explicitly
      flagged as a correction of the same day's earlier (wrong) claim that
      they were necessarily display-only.
    - Verified: full `cmake --build build` clean, `ctest` clean (including
      the deliberate-break-then-restore above), `node --check` clean on
      every touched frontend file.
  - **"Save As..." button (2026-08-09, built)**: written just before the
    sort-buttons correction above, to give the project owner a way to
    actually write a dataset's current in-memory bytes to disk for
    real-hardware testing. The underlying write path (`PcgFile::save()`,
    `EditorBridge::saveFileAs()`) already existed from earlier real-
    hardware validation work, but was only reachable via a devtools
    console script -- no UI. Added `EditorBridge::saveFileDialog(datasetId)`
    (`src/bridge/EditorBridge.h`/`.cpp`, bound in `src/main.cpp`): shows a
    native Save dialog (`NativeFileDialog.h`'s `showSaveFileDialog()`,
    already existed but was unused until now) pre-filled with the
    dataset's own filename, then writes to wherever the user picks via the
    same `PcgFile::save()` `saveFileAs()` already uses -- `saveFileAs()`
    itself is untouched, kept as the lower-level path-supplied building
    block. `frontend/pane.js`: a "Save As..." button next to each pane's
    own dataset selector (per-pane, not global, since each pane already
    knows exactly which dataset it's showing -- no ambiguity about which
    dataset to save the way a single global button would have).
    `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: a `window.saveFileDialog()` fake mirroring
    `openFileDialog()`'s existing `window.prompt()` stand-in pattern, since
    mock/browser mode can't write a real file either. Full `cmake --build
    build` clean, `ctest` clean (no C++ test added specifically for this --
    it's a thin dialog/path wrapper around the already-tested
    `PcgFile::save()`/`saveFileAs()`); `node --check` clean on both touched
    frontend files.
  - **`docs/README.md` demoted from a second full copy to a short pointer
    (2026-08-09)**: raised by the project owner directly -- "Maybe we should
    get rid of the README.md over time?" -- after noticing the dual-
    maintenance cost (`docs/README.md` and `docs/content/format/index.md`
    kept in sync by hand, per this file's own "Keep the docs in sync"
    convention) had already caused real drift: a stale, dangling half-
    paragraph in `docs/README.md`'s Transpose section (an old edit that
    removed a sentence but left its tail behind) that `docs/content/
    format/index.md` didn't have, found while reconciling the two before
    this change. Decided against deleting `docs/README.md` outright (it's
    the one file-format reference someone browsing the repo on GitHub, not
    the Hugo site, can read without leaving) or Hugo's `module.mounts`
    (would need frontmatter in the mounted file, which would show as raw
    text at the top of the GitHub-rendered README) -- settled on a short
    pointer instead. `docs/content/format/index.md` is now the single
    canonical file-format reference; `docs/README.md` is a short redirect
    plus a table of contents. Every in-repo citation of `docs/README.md`
    (§N.N section references throughout `src/`, `frontend/`, `tests/`,
    `tools/`, plus `CLAUDE.md`, the top-level `README.md`, `docs/external/
    README.md`, `docs/references/README.md`, `docs/HUGO-SITE.md`) updated
    to point at `docs/content/format/index.md` instead -- except STATE.md's
    own historical entries below this point, deliberately left as-is (a
    changelog records what was true at the time; the section numbers
    themselves didn't change, only which file holds them). Verified: full
    `cmake --build build` clean, `ctest` clean, `node --check` clean on
    every touched frontend file, and a local `hugo --minify` build clean
    (confirms the Hugo site itself, e.g. the `format`/`overview` pages'
    cross-links, wasn't broken by any of the file moves).
  - **Explicitly not committed to being final**: both the project owner and this
    assistant agreed to revisit/rethink this shape as each piece (Program decoder now
    done; chunk-based component wiring next) proves itself against real tests and the
    real UI, rather than committing to it across the whole codebase up front.

--- EXPLORATION: SQLITE-BACKED PATCH DATA MODEL (branch: explore/sqlite-patch-datastore, 2026-08-02, NOT DECIDED) ---

Lives on its own branch, deliberately kept separate from `main` -- this is a genuine
architecture question, not yet a decision, and touches nothing that's currently
shipped. Started from a real, practical concern (memory/perf with several large
`.PCG` files open at once now that Datasets decouple "loaded file" from "pane," see
the ARCHITECTURE section above) and evolved into something bigger worth recording
even in its current unfinished state, so the reasoning isn't lost if this branch sits
for a while.

  - **Where the idea started**: instead of every open dataset holding its own
    full ~50-70MB raw byte buffer in `PcgFile::data_`, back Program (and
    potentially Combi/Set List) storage with SQLite -- an on-disk-backed file
    (not `:memory:`, which wouldn't help RAM at all), so the OS page cache can
    evict cold data instead of everything sitting permanently resident. Since
    `decodeProgramFields()`/`hashProgramRecord()` already operate on a bare
    byte pointer (not on `PcgFile` internals), swapping where that pointer's
    bytes come from -- offset math into `data_` vs. a `SELECT raw FROM
    programs WHERE bank=? AND number=?` -- is invisible to `EditorBridge`'s
    public shape and to any future JS-side component. That property held up
    well and isn't in question.
  - **Where it got more ambitious**: a Program table that persists *across
    sessions*, deduped globally by `content_hash` (not per-dataset) -- "every
    unique Program the editor has ever seen" -- plus a Combi-Timbre table
    modeled as an m:n join to Programs, plus Set List slots as private
    per-row data with a foreign key to a Program/Combi instead of resolving
    bank/number against array lookups by hand. Keeping the raw BLOB per row
    (not just derived columns) keeps this compatible with the project's core
    method -- derived fields stay honestly re-computable if a decoder's
    understanding improves later, rather than becoming a second, driftable
    source of truth.
  - **Where it hit a real wall (the reason this is a branch, not a merged
    change)**: Kronos Program/Combi data is NOT freely content-addressable
    the way the hash-dedup model assumes. A Combi's Timbre reference isn't
    "this Program's content" -- it's "whatever physically sits at raw bank
    code X, number Y," and each sound engine (HD-1, AL-1, CX-3, ...) owns its
    own dedicated bank ranges, so that physical slot has to both exist *and*
    belong to the right engine for the reference to mean anything. Copying a
    CMB bank without its dependent PRG bank(s) doesn't yield "a Combi with
    unknown sounds" -- it yields a structurally broken Combi on the receiving
    unit. (This matches why real commercial patch vendors ship one CMB bank
    plus the one or two specific PRG banks it actually depends on, never an
    arbitrary/whole-unit Program dump.) This is *the* mental block for
    building any "patch manager" on top of a hash-deduped model: content
    hash is a good *compatibility check* ("does bank X/number Y in the
    destination already hold byte-identical content to what this Combi
    expects?"), but it can't be the reference mechanism itself. Any real
    move/merge feature has to solve a physical-placement problem --
    allocating an engine-compatible bank slot in the destination and either
    confirming it already matches or copying the dependency there -- not
    just a content-copy-plus-FK-update problem.
  - **A prerequisite this surfaced that wasn't obvious before, since partly
    resolved (2026-08-02)**: safely moving/merging Combis depends on knowing
    a Program bank's engine. Research (see `docs/external/README.md`)
    turned up more than expected:
    - **Officially confirmed by Korg's own KRONOS Parameter Guide**: a bank
      is either HD-1 or EXi, never mixed -- "Banks can contain either HD-1
      Programs or EXi Programs, but not both" -- and the manual's factory
      table names the *specific* engine per bank by default (INT-D=AL-1,
      INT-E=AL-1 and CX-3, INT-F=STR-1, USER-A=MS-20EX & PolysixEX,
      USER-B=MOD-7, ...). Explicitly the factory *default* -- bank type (and
      by extension real contents) is user-reconfigurable per bank via Global
      mode, and a separately-found community document confirms real
      long-used units routinely drift from this layout. A strong
      default/fallback label set, not a per-file guarantee.
    - **Built and tested (this branch)**: `classifyProgramBankType()`
      (`src/kronos/ProgramDecoder.{h,cpp}`) derives the HD-1/EXi split from
      two signals already parsed at load time -- the bank's own chunk tag
      (`MBK1`=EXi/`PBK1`=HD-1, from `docs/references/PCG-Structure-Kronos-
      DaBlick.txt`) cross-checked against its declared per-record byte
      stride (HD-1=4960/EXi=3706 bytes, from a Synthify community
      spreadsheet, see `docs/external/README.md`) -- deliberately not a
      hardcoded per-bank-index table, since bank type is configurable.
      `ProgramInfo`/`decodeProgram()` now carry a `bankType` field; covered
      by a dedicated synthetic unit test (both match and mismatch cases) in
      `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`, spot-checked with a deliberately broken
      assertion to confirm it fails loudly.
    - **Still open**: the byte-level mechanism itself (chunk tag + the
      4960/3706 stride figures) hasn't been cross-checked against a real
      backup's actual bytes -- no `.PCG` file was available in the
      environment this was built in. The underlying HD-1/EXi model is now
      officially confirmed; this project's specific *detection* of it from
      raw bytes is not, yet. Also still open: which *specific* EXi engine a
      given EXi bank holds isn't decoded anywhere yet (only the HD-1/EXi
      binary split is built) -- the Parameter Guide's factory table is real
      ground truth for that follow-up, whenever it's wanted.
  - **UI enforcement (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: the per-pane category navbar (see above)
    made it easy to point two panes at two *different* datasets and drag a Setlist
    slot between them -- which surfaced this problem concretely: `copyEntry` happily
    copied a Song's bank/number as-is into the other dataset, even though that
    bank/number is a physical-location reference meaningful only within its own
    dataset's Program/Combi tables. `app.js`'s `onDropEntry` now rejects any
    cross-dataset Setlist copy outright (same-dataset cross-Setlist-list copy, and
    same-list reorder, are unaffected -- both stay within one `PcgFile`, safe).
    `pane.js` also shows this during the drag itself (not just after dropping): a
    shared `draggedFromDatasetId` variable (a plain JS side channel, since
    DataTransfer's payload isn't readable during `dragover` for a same-page drag)
    lets a row being hovered skip `preventDefault()` when the drag came from a
    different dataset, so the browser shows its own "not allowed" cursor and no
    `drop` event fires there at all. Revisit once the physical-bank-position
    problem above is actually solved -- not before.
  - **Category: a second, parallel physical-reference problem (researched 2026-08-03,
    not built)**: prompted by wanting to know what has to be checked/reassigned when
    moving a Program or Combi between datasets. Category (Keyboard/Bass/Strings/etc.,
    used to browse sounds by type regardless of bank/number) turns out to be the SAME
    shape of problem as Bank type -- confirmed via the official Kronos Parameter Guide
    (see `docs/external/Korg-Kronos-Parameter-Guide-Category-excerpt.txt`): each
    Program and Combi (two SEPARATE 18-main x 8-sub-category tables, not shared) is
    assigned a small Main Category (0-17) + Sub Category (0-7) index, but the *names*
    for those indices -- including all 16 "factory" names, not just the 2 open User
    slots -- live in a per-unit-customizable table in Global settings ("Global P3:
    Category Name"), saved via "Write Global Setting." So a Program's category index
    is portable, but its *meaning* isn't guaranteed to match between two datasets whose
    category tables have been renamed differently -- confirms the project owner's
    instinct that moving Programs/Combis between datasets may need explicit user
    confirmation/reassignment when category tables don't match. Not solved, not built
    -- two concrete, not-yet-started follow-ups: (1) locate Category/Sub-Category's
    byte offset in a Program record and (separately) a Combi record -- not in this
    project's own findings, the Synthify spreadsheet, or DaBlick's notes, so genuinely
    unexplored, same as the rest of `GLB1`; needs the same purpose-built test file
    approach already used for Font size/Transpose/Combi Timbre refs. (2) Parse `GLB1`
    itself, at minimum enough to extract both category name tables -- `GLB1` has never
    been touched at all (see Blind Spot #5).
  - **Setlist Bank-jump button, refined (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: a Setlist row's Bank cell
    is a button (`frontend/pane.js`'s `.bank-jump-button`, `stopPropagation()`-ed so it
    doesn't also toggle that row's Comment editor), styled with the same `.lib-tab`
    class as the category nav itself (not a text link) per explicit feedback. Clicking
    it switches this pane to its Programs/Combis category and expands+scrolls to that
    exact entry (`createLibraryPanels()`'s `jumpToEntry()`, found via a `data-entry-key`
    attribute added to each rendered row). `createPane()`'s category-tab-click logic was
    factored into a shared `switchCategory()` so both the tab buttons and this jump
    action stay in sync through one place. The scroll itself computes an exact target
    position (`scrollRowBelowHeader()`, via `getBoundingClientRect()`) so the row always
    lands just below the table's sticky header instead of `scrollIntoView({block:
    "center"})`, which could leave a row (especially one near the top of the list) still
    partly hidden behind it.
  - **Bank-filter buttons (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: the Programs and Combis panels each get
    a row of toggle buttons (one per bank name, between the Name search and the table)
    reusing the bank-name arrays `pane.js` already has. Only buttons for banks actually
    present in the current dataset are enabled; all enabled banks start "pressed"
    (shown) on every fresh dataset load, independently toggleable per category after
    that -- an inclusive multi-select filter, not a single-bank picker. `jumpToEntry()`
    (above) force-presses the target bank before rendering, so a Bank-jump can never
    land on a row its own filter has hidden.
  - **Bank names shortened + button/column widths equalized (BUILT 2026-08-04,
    frontend-only)**: `pane.js`'s `PROGRAM_BANK_NAMES`/`COMBI_BANK_NAMES` now hold
    "I-A".."I-G"/"U-A".."U-FF" (was "INT-A"/"USER-AA" etc.) -- purely a UI-layer
    shortening, not a change to the ground-truth naming: `PcgFile.cpp`'s confirmed
    Timbre bank-code table (`INT-A`=0, `USER-D`=20, ...) and the docs are untouched, a
    new `abbreviateBankName()` helper in `pane.js` shortens a bridge-provided full name
    (e.g. a Timbre's `bankName`) only at render time (`library.js`'s
    `formatTimbreRef()`). `formatBankNumber()` also switched from `"I-C-000"` to
    `"I-C 000"` (space, not dash). Freed-up width let `.col-bank` shrink 9em -> 6.5em
    and `.col-refs` 10em -> 4.5em (paired with renaming the "Setlist refs"/"Combi refs"/
    "Setlist references"/"Combi references" column headers, inconsistent across the
    Programs/Combis/Duplicates tables, to a uniform `#STL`/`#CMB` with a title tooltip
    spelling out the full meaning). Buttons that used to size to their own label's
    length (bank-filter buttons, the Setlist Bank-jump button, the Setlist/Programs/
    Combis/Duplicates category tabs) now share a fixed width per group
    (`.bank-filter-button` 3.6em, `.bank-jump-button` 100% of its now-narrower table
    cell, `.pane-category-tabs .lib-tab` 6.5em) so each row of buttons lines up evenly
    instead of looking ragged.
  - **Setlist row columns trimmed (BUILT 2026-08-04, frontend-only)**: Hold Time
    dropped from the row entirely (still fetched/returned by `getEntries()` --
    `entry.holdTime` is just not rendered here -- planned to resurface in the Comment
    editor panel later, not lost). The separate Color column (a small swatch) is gone
    too -- its color now paints the "#" slot-number cell's own background instead
    (`idxTd.style.background`, same unverified-placeholder hue formula as before, see
    the code comment -- **not** Korg's real color palette, no ground truth for that
    exists yet). Song name column narrowed 15em -> 10.5em (`.col-song`, a 30% cut from
    the same 15em/24-char baseline `.col-name` uses for Program/Combi names -- Set List
    slot names are confirmed the same 24-byte field, docs/README.md §3) -- wraps rather
    than ellipsis-truncates, since this cell can also hold a second line (the
    cross-referenced instrument name) that a hard truncate would clip along with it.
  - **Horizontal scrollbar bug fixed + columns shrunk to fit 800px (BUILT 2026-08-04,
    frontend-only)**: root cause -- `.entries-scroll`/`.library-body` only set
    `overflow-y: auto`, and per spec, leaving `overflow-x` at its default `visible`
    while the other axis is non-`visible` makes it compute to `auto` too, not stay
    `visible`. With two panes side by side, the Setlist table's column widths summed to
    more than a pane's actual width at the app's own 800px minimum (`main.cpp:81`'s
    `setMinimumSize(800, 500)`, unchanged/already correct), so that implicit `auto`
    kicked in as a real horizontal scrollbar. Fixed both properly (`overflow-x: hidden`
    is now explicit on both, so a scrollbar can never reappear by accident) and by
    actually shrinking columns to fit: `.col-index` (`#`) 3.5em -> 1.75em (50%),
    `.col-narrow` (Type/Vol) 4.5em -> 3.15em and `.col-bank` 6.5em -> 4.55em (30% each,
    shared classes so this also affects the Programs/Combis library tables' Type/Bank
    columns, not just Setlist). `.col-bank`'s `white-space: nowrap` was removed too --
    at the new width a label like "U-AA 009" needs to wrap onto a second line rather
    than force the column wider than its declared width. Also added `min-width: 800px`
    to `html, body` -- mirrors the native window's own floor so a plain browser tab
    (mock_bridge.js's no-native-app testing mode) can't be resized narrower than what
    the real app ever allows, which is exactly the width this bug only showed up at.
  - **Real fix for the shrink-layout bugs (BUILT 2026-08-04, supersedes the previous
    attempt, frontend-only)**: the previous pass (`overflow-x: hidden` + `min-width:
    800px` on `html`/`body`) didn't actually work -- reported back as three symptoms:
    the native window's own 800px minimum appearing not to be respected, the right
    pane going partly invisible when shrinking, and columns not visibly shrinking at
    all. Root causes, actually isolated this time:
    - `min-width: 800px` on `html, body` was actively harmful, not just insufficient --
      it forces the PAGE to stay 800px wide regardless of the WebView's real viewport
      width, so the instant the actual window (or content view, mid-resize) is even
      slightly under that, the page overflows its own viewport: a scrollbar appears and
      whatever's past the edge (the right pane) is genuinely off-screen, not just
      visually squeezed. This is almost certainly what made the OS-level
      `setMinimumSize(800, 500)` (`main.cpp:81`, itself unchanged and believed correct
      -- a plain, standard `NSWindow setContentMinSize:` call, no custom resize delegate
      overriding it) look like it wasn't being respected. **Removed** -- the page must
      be able to shrink freely below 800px so it's never wider than its actual viewport
      under any circumstance.
    - The real cause of the right pane vanishing: `.panes` is a CSS grid, and a grid
      item's default `min-width` is `auto`, which resolves to its CONTENT's min-content
      size, not 0 -- so `.pane` (the grid item) could never shrink below whatever its
      content naturally needed, no matter how narrow the `1fr` track was asked to go.
      Same underlying issue one level deeper too: `.pane-category-content` is a flex
      item (in `.pane`'s column flex container) on its cross axis, subject to the exact
      same content-based-minimum default. Fixed by adding `min-width: 0` to both --
      `.entries-scroll`/`.library-body` already got this for free from their own
      `overflow-x: hidden` (per spec, non-visible overflow on an element makes ITS OWN
      automatic minimum resolve to 0), but that never helped the ANCESTOR grid/flex
      items further up the chain, which needed the same treatment explicitly.
    - Why columns weren't visibly shrinking: `.entries-table` never set `table-layout`,
      so it defaulted to `auto` -- in auto layout, a CSS `width` on a `<td>`/`<th>` is
      only a *hint* the browser can still override to fit content (a button's own
      minimum size, an unbroken label, ...), not a hard constraint. Switched to
      `table-layout: fixed`, which makes the first row's declared widths authoritative;
      content now wraps/clips to fit instead of pushing the column wider.
    - **Per explicit request, redesigned as "hard-locked narrow columns + exactly one
      resizable column"**, rather than the previous percentage-shrink pass: `.col-index`,
      `.col-narrow`, `.col-bank`, `.col-refs`, and (new) `.col-badges` now all set
      `width`/`min-width`/`max-width` to the identical value (a genuine lock, not a
      hint, now that layout is `fixed`) -- `.col-song` (Setlist) and `.col-name`
      (Programs/Combis) are the only columns left with no width at all, so they're the
      sole ones that grow/shrink with the pane. `.col-badges` used to be the
      Combis table's own "soaks up leftover space" column (`width: auto`); now fixed at
      10em so `.col-name` is unambiguously the only resizable one there too.
  - **Column widths redone via <colgroup> (BUILT 2026-08-04, supersedes the em-on-
    th/td attempt above, frontend-only)**: the `table-layout: fixed` + hard-locked
    em-width `.col-*` classes pass looked reasonable but was reported completely
    broken in practice (the `#` column rendering far smaller than declared, every
    fixed column refusing to actually resize, Name blowing out). Root cause: `table-
    layout: fixed` only takes each column's width from cells in the table's first
    row, and `.entries-table th` sets `font-size: 12px` while most `<td>`s inherit
    14px (or their own 12px override, inconsistently) -- so an `em`-based width meant
    two different pixel values depending on whether the browser happened to key off
    the `<th>` or a `<td>`, silently producing widths nothing close to intended.
    **Fixed properly with `<colgroup>`**: a new `colgroupHtml(widthsPx)` helper in
    `pane.js` builds `<col style="width:Npx">` per column (absolute px, `null` for
    the one column meant to flex) -- `<col>` width is font-size-independent, shared
    identically by every cell in that column, and is what `table-layout: fixed`
    actually expects to key off. Every `.entries-table` (Setlist in `pane.js`,
    Programs/Combis/Duplicates in `library.js`) now opens with a `colgroupHtml(...)`
    call; the `.col-*` CSS classes are cosmetic-only now (color, font-size, text
    wrapping) -- no width/min-width/max-width left on any of them. Widths chosen
    (px): Setlist `[21, flex, 38, 55, 38]` for #/Song/Type/Bank/Vol; Programs `[55,
    flex, 38, 54, 54]` for Bank/Name/Type/#STL/#CMB (also gave Programs' Name cell
    the `.col-name` class it was missing before, so it gets the same ellipsis
    treatment Combis' always had); Combis `[55, flex, 160, 54]` for Bank/Name/Set
    Lists/#STL (Set Lists -- `.col-badges` -- used to be the "soaks up leftover
    space" column here too, which meant TWO resizable columns competing for the same
    space; now fixed at 160px so Name is unambiguously the only one); Duplicates
    `[55, 54, 54]`, no flexible column (matches its original design -- the group name
    is shown above the table, not in a column).
  - **Missing links in the min-width: 0 chain (BUILT 2026-08-04, supersedes the
    <colgroup> pass above -- that pass was reported as making zero visible
    difference)**: after the <colgroup> fix still tested as completely unchanged,
    re-audited the full flex/grid ancestor chain from `body` down to the table and
    found it was fixed at the wrong end. `.pane` and `.pane-category-content` had
    `min-width: 0` (the previous round's fix), but `.view` (a flex item of `body`,
    column flex, cross axis = width) and `.panes` (a flex item of `.view`, same
    trap) did NOT -- and since a flex/grid item's content-based auto-minimum applies
    at EVERY level independently, leaving even one un-fixed level upstream stops the
    whole chain from ever reaching the levels that were already fixed. The window
    could never actually get narrow enough for the colgroup's px widths to matter,
    which is exactly why that pass changed nothing observable. Added `min-width: 0`
    to both `.view` and `.panes`, completing the chain: `body -> .view -> .panes ->
    .pane -> .pane-category-content` all now either set `min-width: 0` explicitly or
    (`.entries-scroll`/`.library-body`) get the same effect for free from their own
    `overflow-x: hidden`.
  - **Tables rebuilt as CSS Grid, not HTML table layout (BUILT 2026-08-04, supersedes
    both the em/th-td and <colgroup> attempts above -- per explicit "the layout is
    beyond repair, kick in a real grid system" request)**: after the min-width: 0 chain
    was completed and STILL reported as no better ("same"), decided to stop fighting
    HTML table-layout algorithms entirely rather than keep patching around their
    quirks (first-row-only column sizing, th/td font-size context mismatches, engine-
    specific auto/fixed differences). Every `.entries-table` (Setlist in `pane.js`,
    Programs/Combis/Duplicates in `library.js`) is now a genuine CSS Grid: `display:
    grid` on the `<table>`, `display: contents` on `<thead>`/`<tbody>`/`<tr>` (removes
    them from the box tree so their `<th>`/`<td>` children become direct grid items,
    while leaving them in the DOM untouched -- existing click/drag handlers on `<tr>`
    still work exactly as before). Column widths are one `grid-template-columns` value
    set as an inline style directly on each `<table>` (`pane.js`'s new
    `gridTemplateColumns(widthsPx)`, replacing the `<colgroup>` helper) -- the same
    solid, explicit mechanism `.panes` (the two-pane split) has used from the start
    without any of these problems. Two knock-on fixes this forced: (1) `colSpan`
    doesn't work under `display: grid` (it's a table-rendering feature), so the three
    full-width expandable rows (`pane.js`'s Comment editor, `library.js`'s Program
    usage panel and Combi Timbre list) now use `td.style.gridColumn = "1 / -1"`
    instead -- while fixing this, found the Program usage row's old `colSpan = 2` was
    stale (Programs has had 5 columns for a while, so it was only ever spanning 2 of
    them), a real pre-existing bug now moot since `1 / -1` always means "all of them."
    (2) `display: contents` rows have no box of their own to paint a background on, so
    row-level hover/drop-target/expanded state (`tbody tr:hover`, `tr.drop-target`,
    `tr.expanded`) now targets each row's `td` children directly instead (`tr:hover
    td`, etc.) -- the state still lives as a class on the `<tr>` in the DOM, unchanged
    in JS, these are just CSS selector adjustments to reach through it. `cursor: grab`
    stayed on `tr` itself since `cursor` inherits through `display: contents` fine
    (only non-inherited properties like background/outline needed moving).
  - **Adopted Bulma for layout/components (STARTED 2026-08-04, pane shell + Setlist
    table done, library.js/Programs/Combis/Duplicates intentionally NOT converted yet)
    -- supersedes hand-rolling our own grid**: after the CSS-Grid-tables rewrite still
    didn't fix things, we asked directly why not use an established framework instead
    of continuing to hand-roll layout primitives. Landed on Bulma over Bootstrap: CSS-
    only (no JS/Popper dependency, fits this app's all-vanilla-JS interaction model --
    we still hand-write every behavior, Bulma only supplies CSS classes), ~24KB
    gzipped, MIT, vendored as one file (`frontend/vendor/bulma.min.css` + a
    `BULMA_VERSION.txt` note, same pattern as `third_party/CHOC_VERSION.txt`) rather
    than CDN-linked, since this app has no general-internet-access assumption
    (`fetchResource` serves everything from local disk). `index.html` sets
    `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>` to force Bulma's dark palette unconditionally
    (checked the CSS -- Bulma auto-dark-mode is keyed off `prefers-color-scheme` by
    default, which would drift from our own hard-coded dark `:root` whenever the OS
    itself isn't in dark mode; `[data-theme=dark]` is a real, explicit override Bulma
    ships for exactly this).
    - **Corrected a wrong assumption before it shipped**: initially claimed Bulma's
      `.column` bakes in the `min-width: 0` fix this whole saga kept needing --
      actually checked the vendored CSS and it does NOT (`.column{flex-basis:0;
      flex-grow:1;flex-shrink:1}`, no min-width). Bulma doesn't make that bug go away
      for free; `.pane`'s own `min-width: 0` (already in style.css) is still what's
      doing the work, just now on an element that also carries Bulma's `.column`
      class. Surfaced this to the project owner mid-task rather than building on the
      wrong premise -- confirmed to proceed anyway, for the grid pattern + component
      value, not because it's automatic.
    - **`.panes`/`.pane` -> Bulma's real `.columns`/`.column`** (`index.html`), not a
      hand-rolled grid -- this was the actual "we need a row/col concept" ask. Both
      Bulma's inter-column gap and each `.column`'s own padding key off one CSS
      variable (`--bulma-column-gap`); zeroed it on `.panes.columns` and kept our own
      `gap: 1px` + `background: var(--border)` (the existing thin divider-line look)
      instead of fighting Bulma's spacing system or duplicating padding.
    - **`is-mobile` on both `.topbar.level` and `.panes.columns`**: Bulma is mobile-
      first -- `.level`/`.columns` only become row layouts past a 769px breakpoint,
      stacking below it. This app's window has an 800px floor (`main.cpp`), which
      clears that breakpoint, but relying on a 31px margin above a breakpoint is
      exactly the class of narrow-width edge case that broke things repeatedly before
      this rewrite -- `is-mobile` forces row layout unconditionally, no breakpoint.
    - **Topbar**: `.level`/`.level-left`/`.level-right` for the Open button + title +
      loading indicator row; Open button and the Setlist table's Bank-jump button are
      now real Bulma `.button.is-small` (was a hand-rolled `.lib-tab` class).
    - **Category nav (Setlist/Programs/Combis/Duplicates)**: Bulma's real
      `.tabs.is-boxed` component (`<ul><li><a>`, active state as `is-active` on the
      `<li>`), replacing the hand-rolled `.lib-tabs`/`.lib-tab` buttons entirely for
      this nav specifically -- `switchCategory()` updated to toggle `is-active`.
      `.lib-tab` itself is NOT deleted -- library.js's bank-filter-row buttons still
      use it, unconverted on purpose (explicit scope: pane/Setlist-table first).
    - **Form controls**: `.setlist-select`/`.dataset-select` wrapped in Bulma's
      `.select` (`.is-fullwidth` for the Setlist one), `.filter-input` gained Bulma's
      `.input` class, `.setlist-info` gained `.help`. Checked Bulma's actual CSS before
      deleting our own hand-rolled background/border/padding/disabled-opacity rules
      for these -- confirmed `.input`/`.select.is-fullwidth` already handle
      width:100% and disabled state on their own, so that hand-rolled CSS was dead
      weight once removed; the one thing Bulma can't infer on its own (which flex item
      should grow in a specific layout) stayed as a small `.dataset-select-wrap{flex:1}`
      rule.
    - **Explicitly deferred, not forgotten**: library.js's Programs/Combis/Duplicates
      panels (bank-filter-row buttons, the data tables themselves) are UNCONVERTED --
      still `.lib-tab`-styled buttons and the CSS-Grid-based `.entries-table` mechanism
      from the previous pass. Per explicit instruction, Bulma adoption lands here next,
      once the pane shell + Setlist table are confirmed working.
  - **Setlist rebuilt as a real Bulma table + Library (Programs/Combis/Duplicates)
    fully converted too (BUILT 2026-08-04)** -- two rounds landed together:
    - **Setlist**: back to a real `<table>` (Bulma's `.table.is-fullwidth.is-hoverable
      .is-narrow`), not the CSS-Grid-dressed-as-a-table hack from the previous pass --
      per explicit "remove all non-Bulma CSS from the tables and rows" request. Column
      widths moved from px to a genuine 12-based grid (`pane.js`'s `colgroupHtml()`,
      mirroring Bulma's own `.column.is-1..is-12` convention) expressed as percentages
      via `<colgroup><col style="width:N%">`, so the table scales with its container.
      `colSpan` is back to a plain attribute (was a `grid-column: 1/-1` workaround).
      Row highlight (Comment editor open) uses Bulma's real `tr.is-selected`, not a
      hand-rolled `.expanded` class; row hover comes from Bulma's `.is-hoverable`, no
      custom CSS needed at all. What's left as genuinely irreducible custom CSS:
      column-width locking itself (`table-layout: fixed`, since Bulma's `.table` has
      no column-layout system whatsoever), an opaque sticky-header background (Bulma's
      table head background is transparent by default), and two real app-specific
      states no framework has a concept for (drag-and-drop's drop-target hint, "this
      row has a Comment").
    - **Column-width floors**: `<col>` doesn't support `min-width` (ignored by
      browsers), and `table-layout: fixed` ignores per-cell width/min-width past the
      first row -- so a per-column minimum can only live on the `<col>` itself, via
      `calc(N% + Mpx)`. `colgroupHtml()` now accepts `{frac, extraPx}` per column;
      Setlist's #/Type/Vol get +5px, Bank +10px (the jump-button's "I-C 000" text
      needs more room).
    - **Library (Programs/Combis/Duplicates) converted the same way**, closing out the
      staged rollout: same real-`<table>` + `colgroupHtml()` + `tr.is-selected`
      pattern for all three. Bank-filter-row buttons moved from the hand-rolled
      `.lib-tab` to Bulma's `.button.is-small` (pressed/active state via `is-link`,
      the idiomatic Bulma way to show a toggle button as active -- Bulma has no
      dedicated toggle-button component). Set List reference pills (Combis) moved
      from a hand-rolled `.badge`/`.badge-list` to Bulma's real `.tags`/`.tag`
      component. With library.js off it, the entire old CSS-Grid-table mechanism
      (`.entries-table`, its `display: contents` thead/tbody/tr hack, `.col-narrow`/
      `.col-bank`/`.col-refs`/`.col-name`, `.badge-list`/`.badge`, `.library-table`,
      `.lib-tab`/`:hover`/`.active`, `pane.js`'s `gridTemplateColumns()`) had nothing
      left using it -- deleted outright rather than left as dead code.
    - **Fixed a real, unrelated bug found along the way**: the topbar loading spinner
      never actually hid. Root cause -- `.topbar-loading` also carries Bulma's
      `.level-right`, and since it lives inside `.level.is-mobile`, Bulma's actual
      matching rule is `.level.is-mobile .level-right{display:flex}` (3 combined
      classes, specificity 0,0,3,0), which beat our `.topbar-loading[hidden]{display:
      none}` (0,0,2,0) outright regardless of the `hidden` attribute. Fixed with a
      deliberate, narrow `!important` -- the right tool for "must win over a
      third-party framework's conflicting rule for a boolean visibility toggle."
  - **Real Bootstrap-style responsive breakpoints (BUILT 2026-08-04)**: two changes,
    both using Bulma's mobile-first `is-N-mobile`/`is-N-tablet` column-size classes
    (verified against the actual CSS before relying on them: `.column.is-12-mobile`
    is unconditional `width:100%`, `.column.is-6-tablet` only applies inside `@media
    (min-width:769px)` -- and critically, `.columns` WITHOUT `.is-mobile` isn't
    `display:flex` at all below that breakpoint, so `.column` children just stack as
    plain blocks with no wrapping logic needed).
    - **Dataset-select and the category tabs share one responsive row (BUILT
      2026-08-04, corrected same-day)**: the first attempt put them in two separate,
      always-stacked `.columns` rows -- wrong mechanism, per follow-up clarification
      the actual want was Bootstrap's `col-12 col-lg-6` pattern: ONE row that wraps
      into two stacked rows below a breakpoint and merges into one side-by-side row
      above it. Fixed: both back in a single `.columns.is-multiline` row, each
      `.column.is-12-mobile.is-6-desktop` -- full width (stacked, 12+12 doesn't fit
      one row) below Bulma's 1024px desktop breakpoint, half width each (side by
      side, 6+6=12 fits exactly) from there up. `.is-multiline` is load-bearing here
      specifically: the container's own flex-activation breakpoint (769px, tablet) is
      EARLIER than the width-override breakpoint (1024px, desktop) it's paired with,
      so without it, the 769-1024px range would be a flex row of two still-full-width
      items with nothing telling them to wrap -- they'd overflow instead of stacking.
      (`.panes` below doesn't have this mismatch -- its own flex-activation and
      width-override are both 769px, so no `.is-multiline` needed there.) The app's
      default window (1100px, `main.cpp`) clears 1024px, so this is genuinely visible
      in normal use -- shrink the window below ~1024px total (not per-pane, Bulma
      breakpoints are viewport-width-based) to see it stack.
    - **The two-pane split (.panes/.pane) is genuinely responsive now**, not forced
      side-by-side: `is-mobile` removed from `.panes`, `.pane` gained `is-12-mobile
      is-6-tablet` -- stacks full-width below 769px, side-by-side (half each) above
      it. The app's own window has an 800px floor (`main.cpp`), comfortably clearing
      769px, so the native app always renders side-by-side either way; the stacking
      only becomes externally visible testing in a plain browser tab narrower than
      that (mock_bridge.js's no-build mode). The topbar's `.level` keeps its
      unconditional `is-mobile` (nothing useful to stack a title bar into).
  - **Pane-header breakpoint written directly, not via Bulma's grid (BUILT
    2026-08-04, supersedes the .columns.is-multiline attempt above -- reported as
    still not responding to the breakpoint at all)**: reasoning through the Bulma
    mechanism (mismatched 769px container-flex-activation vs 1024px width-override
    breakpoints, `.is-multiline` needed to bridge them) held up on paper, but with no
    screen access to debug Bulma's own minified cascade against what actually
    rendered, kept relying on an unverifiable chain of reasoning wasn't going
    anywhere. Replaced with a small, self-contained rule: `.pane-header-row{display:
    flex;flex-wrap:wrap}`, `.pane-header-col{flex:1 1 100%}` (stacked by default),
    one `@media(min-width:1024px)` flipping to `flex:1 1 0` (side by side, shared
    equally). Same lesson as the entries-table saga a few rounds back -- when a
    framework mechanism can't be visually verified and keeps failing, a few lines of
    plain CSS beat continuing to reason about a library's internals blind.
  - **View-hint row removed, moved to a native hover tooltip (BUILT 2026-08-04)**:
    the always-visible `.view-hint` text row is gone; checked first whether Bulma has
    a tooltip component to use instead (it doesn't -- tooltips were historically a
    separate, unbundled Bulma extension, not part of core) -- used the plain HTML
    `title` attribute instead (a real native hover tooltip, zero JS/CSS/extra markup
    needed), attached to the topbar's own `<h1>`.
  - **Column-width regression: calc() on <col> suspected and removed (BUILT
    2026-08-04)**: reported as "only the Song/Name column shows, everything else is
    invisible" on all four tables (Setlist, Programs, Combis, Duplicates). Root cause
    not independently confirmed (no way to inspect actual rendered layout in this
    environment), but correlates exactly with the one thing that changed since the
    last confirmed-good state: the previous pass added a per-column pixel floor via
    `calc(pct% + Npx)` on each `<col>`'s width, to bake in a min-width `<col>` doesn't
    support natively. `<col>` elements have historically had weak, inconsistent
    cross-engine support for anything beyond a plain width value -- treating that as
    the likely cause even though `calc()` on a `<col>` width is spec-legal. Reverted
    `colgroupHtml()` to plain percentages only, no calc(), across all four tables
    (`pane.js`'s Setlist + `library.js`'s Programs/Combis/Duplicates all share the
    one helper). The "make some columns a bit wider" intent from before is now
    expressed as a non-integer fraction instead (e.g. `1.3` instead of `{frac:1,
    extraPx:5}`) -- same idea, no calc() involved, `colgroupHtml()` already accepted
    any number, not just whole ones.
  - **Bank-filter buttons moved out of the scrolling table area (BUILT 2026-08-04)**:
    they used to live inside `.library-body` (the same scroll container as the
    table), so they scrolled out of view along with the rows -- moved to a new
    `.bank-filter-area` sibling ABOVE `.library-body`, between the Name search input
    and the table, always visible regardless of scroll position. `showPanel()` now
    also toggles which category's bank-filter row (if either -- Duplicates has none)
    is shown, mirroring how it already toggled `panels`. While doing this, proactively
    fixed the same `[hidden]`-losing-to-our-own-unconditional-`display`-rule bug the
    topbar spinner had a few rounds back (`.bank-filter-row[hidden]{display:none}`,
    explicit rather than assumed) -- caught before it needed reporting a second time.
  - **Program bank type (HD-1/EXi) surfaced in the UI (BUILT 2026-08-05)**: was already
    classified and stored per-Program (`ProgramInfo::bankType`, exposed via
    `listPrograms()`), but nothing showed it except the Programs table's own dedicated
    Type column -- the Programs bank-filter buttons and the Setlist/Duplicates Bank
    labels had no way to show it without a specific Program row in hand. Added
    `PcgFile::programBankTypes()` (new, one entry per bank: `{bank, bankType}`,
    derived from the already-classified `programBankLocations_`, no new parsing) and a
    matching lightweight bridge call `getProgramBankTypes(datasetId)` -- much cheaper
    than fetching all ~2560 Program records just to label ~20 banks. Covered by a new
    `pcg_file_test` assertion (verified failing before restoring the correct expected
    value, this project's usual deliberate-break-then-restore check).
    `pane.js`'s `formatBankNumber(entry, bankType)` now takes an optional bank type and
    appends `" (HD-1)"`/`" (EXi)"` -- only ever for Programs (Combis have no engine type
    of their own, so it's a no-op there regardless of what's passed). Wired into: the
    Programs bank-filter buttons (`"U-A (EXi)"`), the Setlist Bank-jump button when it
    points at a Program (`"U-A 008 (EXi)"`), and the Duplicates table's Bank cell
    (which -- unlike Programs -- has no separate Type column, so this is genuinely new
    information there, not a repeat of an adjacent column). Deliberately NOT added to
    the Programs table's own Bank cell, since its Type column already shows the same
    fact right next to it -- would just be the same information twice in one row.
    `createPane()` now fetches+caches this once per dataset load (a `bank -> type` Map)
    and shares it with both `createSetlistPanel()` and `createLibraryPanels()`, so the
    bridge call happens once per dataset change, not once per renderer. Two follow-on
    CSS fixes this forced: `.bank-filter-button`'s old fixed 3.6em width (fine when
    every label was uniformly "I-A".."U-FF") had to go, since `"U-AA (EXi)"` varies too
    much in length now; and Bulma's `.button` forces `white-space: nowrap` by default,
    which would have made the Setlist Bank-jump button overflow its cell once the
    suffix made its text much longer -- overridden to `white-space: normal` so it wraps
    onto a second line instead, plus its column's colgroup fraction bumped 2.6 -> 3.5.
    Caveat carried through honestly, not smoothed over: `ProgramBankType` itself is
    per-file-derived (Kronos OS 3.0+ lets a user reassign INT Program Banks between
    HD-1/EXi, so it was never going to be a hardcoded table) and is flagged in
    `PcgFile.h`'s own doc comment as **not yet independently verified against a real
    Kronos backup** -- this UI surfaces that classification more prominently now, not
    a newly-confirmed fact.
  - **Program drag-and-drop: the first feature that writes immediately into the
    native buffer (BUILT 2026-08-05)**: per explicit direction, editor operations
    stop being purely in-memory-bookkeeping from here on -- this is the first one
    that actually writes into a dataset's retained raw bytes (`data_`), not just
    `setlists_`. Planned via `EnterPlanMode` given the scope (first real write path,
    touches the physical-bank-placement problem this branch exists to explore) --
    plan file preserved the full design reasoning; summary here.
    - **`PcgFile::copyProgramFrom(src, srcBank, srcNumber, dstBank, dstNumber)`**
      (new): copies one Program record's raw bytes from `src` (pass `*this` for a
      same-dataset copy) into this file's target slot, re-decoding the destination's
      `programs()` entry from the freshly-written bytes so cached fields never go
      stale. Five guards, checked in order, nothing written unless all pass:
      out-of-range bank/number, engine-type mismatch (HD-1 record into an EXi bank
      would corrupt it, or vice versa -- this is exactly why bank type was surfaced
      in the UI just before this), a record-size mismatch as a defensive second
      check on top of the type check, the target slot already holding a *different*
      Program (confirmed explicitly with the project owner as a real, no-undo
      action worth a hard block, not silently overwritten), and a byte-identical
      Program already existing anywhere in the destination file. New
      `programBankTypeAt()` (single-bank lookup) alongside it.
    - **Real bug caught and fixed by the test, not by inspection**: the
      duplicate-exists check initially compared the source record's hash against
      *every* entry in the destination's `programs()`, including the source's own
      slot -- which trivially matches itself, so every same-dataset copy rejected
      itself as "a duplicate of itself." Caught immediately because
      `testCopyProgramFrom()` (new, `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp`) actually exercises a
      real same-dataset copy, not just the rejection paths -- fixed by excluding
      only the exact source slot from that comparison (not its whole bank), and
      only when `&src == this`. Also deliberately broken-then-restored once more,
      per this project's usual practice.
    - **`EditorBridge::copyProgram(args)`**: `[srcDatasetId, srcBank, srcNumber,
      dstDatasetId, dstBank, dstNumber] -> {ok}` or `{ok:false, error}`, same or
      different dataset both work (`fileOf()` twice, no aliasing risk since
      distinct (bank, number) pairs never overlap in byte range even when
      `srcDatasetId == dstDatasetId`).
    - **Cross-dataset copying is allowed for Programs specifically** -- confirmed
      with the project owner this doesn't reopen the physical-bank-placement
      problem the SQLite exploration flagged as hard: unlike a Setlist slot or a
      Combi Timbre, nothing *outside* a dataset can already be pointing at one of
      its Program slots, so copying raw bytes into another dataset's slot doesn't
      leave any dangling/wrong reference behind. Setlist's own `onDropEntry`
      (`app.js`) stays same-dataset-only, unchanged.
    - **Frontend**: Programs rows are draggable now (`library.js`, was explicitly
      "not draggable yet" until this pass) -- drag one onto another (same pane or a
      different pane's dataset) to copy. `app.js`'s new `onDropProgram` mirrors
      `onDropEntry`'s shape but only refreshes the *destination* dataset's panes
      (a copy never touches the source, unlike Setlist's swap/copy). Live
      type-mismatch feedback during `dragover` (before drop, not just after) reuses
      each row's own already-known `bankType` -- no extra bridge call needed beyond
      what the bank-type-in-UI pass already wired up. `.programs-table` shares its
      `cursor:grab`/`.drop-target` CSS with `.setlist-table` rather than duplicating
      it (one rule, two selectors).
    - **Not built**: any UI for the reverse direction (does the source disappear?
      No -- copy, not move, confirmed explicitly) or a "target occupied, overwrite
      anyway?" confirmation -- the third guard above is a hard block instead, since
      this app has no modal UI anywhere yet and building one just for this would be
      scope creep beyond what was asked.
  - **Real Kronos Set List slot colors (BUILT 2026-08-05)**: the "#" cell's
    background color used to be a synthetic hue-spread placeholder
    (`hsl(color*47%360, ...)`), explicitly flagged as not Korg's real palette.
    Replaced with `pane.js`'s `SETLIST_COLOR_NAMES`/`SETLIST_COLOR_HEX` (16 real
    color names from the official Korg manual, English + German, provided by the
    project owner) -- **ordering not yet independently confirmed against a real
    Kronos** (noted explicitly in both the code comment and here, per this
    project's "no guessing" standard); the array order is the order they were
    given in (reads like the on-device menu order), a working assumption pending
    a real-hardware cross-check the project owner will do later. Hex values are
    this project's own muted approximation of each named color (not sampled from
    real hardware either), deliberately kept dark enough that the existing
    dim-gray cell text stays legible on top of any of them -- White specifically
    can't be real white for that reason, see the code comment. `mock_bridge.js`'s
    fake Setlist songs now cycle through all 16 colors (`(k % 16) + 1`) instead of
    a fixed `color: 1`, so mock mode can actually exercise the full palette
    visually without needing a real backup file.
  - **Bank-filter grid alignment + Timbre reference engine type/Program name (BUILT
    2026-08-05)**: three small follow-ups from real usage.
    - `.bank-filter-row` moved from `flex-wrap` to a real CSS grid
      (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(6.5em, 1fr))`) -- flex-wrap
      left each button hugging its own label's width, which read as ragged once
      labels started varying in length ("I-A" vs "U-AA (EXi)"); the grid gives every
      column the same width regardless of label length.
    - Combi Timbre references now show engine type and the actual Program name
      (`library.js`'s `formatTimbreRef()`), not just bank/number -- the name was
      "already in memory anyway" per the request: `programs` is the exact array this
      panel already fetched for its own Programs table, just searched by
      (bank, number), no new bridge call. Both are gated to
      `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank()`'s confirmed range (at the time, bank 0-3 /
      INT-A..D only -- **extended 2026-08-08 to 8 banks total, INT-A..D plus
      USER-A/D/F/AA, see the ARCHITECTURE entry below**)
      `EditorBridge::combiUsagesForProgram()`/`combiUsageCounts()` already use for
      the #CMB column -- outside that range, a Timbre's raw bank code isn't
      confirmed to mean the same thing as a Program's own `.bank` field at all, so
      showing a type/name for it would be a guess dressed up as a lookup, exactly
      what got flagged when a Combi showed `"Timbre 5: code 19 085"` with nothing
      else -- that's not a bug, it's the honest "don't know" case working as
      designed, and is the same reason a name/type can't safely be added for it
      either (mirrored in `mock_bridge.js`: one fake Timbre now deliberately matches
      a fake Program's bank/number so the new lookup has something to demonstrate
      in mock mode too).
  - **Indeterminate loading spinner (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: a pane-wide overlay
    (`.pane-loading`) shown for the duration of a file drop's base64-encode/decode+parse
    -- genuinely indeterminate, since no byte-level progress callback exists for that
    path yet (a real percentage bar would need the transfer itself restructured into
    chunks with progress events, a bigger follow-up, see Blind Spot #15).
  - **Global mode scope, when it's picked up (not started)**: intentionally narrow --
    for now, just pull the category name tables (Program's and Combi's, separately), not
    a general `GLB1` parse. Matches this project's "only extract what's currently
    needed" convention (see `docs/content/components/index.md`) -- other Global
    settings stay unparsed until something concrete needs them.
  - **Not decided, not scheduled**: no schema has been written, no SQLite
    dependency has been added, nothing here has touched `main`. This section
    exists so the reasoning survives even if this branch is set aside for a
    while -- update it in place as the exploration continues, rather than
    letting the thread live only in chat history.

--- NATIVE FILE DIALOG + PROGRESS (branch: explore/sqlite-patch-datastore, 2026-08-03, Phase 1 built) ---

A distinct thread of work from the SQLite exploration above (just landed on the same
branch) -- prompted by asking how the native side actually reads a file today, which
surfaced two real gaps: no working native Open/Save dialog (drag-and-drop is the only
mechanism, specifically *because* the native one is broken -- see Blind Spots), and no
real progress reporting (the loading spinner we built is necessarily indeterminate,
since the whole current pipeline is one monolithic base64-encode-in-JS /
base64-decode-and-parse-in-C++ step with no chunking at all).

  - **Root cause of the broken native dialog, confirmed by reading CHOC's own source**:
    `choc_WebView.h`'s `runOpenPanelWithParameters` delegate (triggered by an
    `<input type="file">` from inside the page) opens `NSOpenPanel` via
    `beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:` -- a *sheet*, attached to the
    WKWebView's own window. That's the documented z-order bug. A directly-invoked,
    **app-modal** `runModal` call is a genuinely different code path -- not attached to
    any window at all, so there's no window for it to end up behind.
  - **BUILT (Phase 1)**: `src/platform/NativeFileDialog.h`/`.cpp` (new) -- macOS-only for
    now, calls `NSOpenPanel`/`NSSavePanel` directly via `choc::objc` (CHOC's own reusable
    Objective-C call helpers, `third_party/choc/choc/platform/choc_ObjectiveCHelpers.h`
    -- safe to include unconditionally, the whole file is `#if CHOC_APPLE`-guarded) and
    `runModal`, bypassing CHOC's own broken delegate entirely. `isNativeFileDialogSupported()`
    lets callers distinguish "not supported on this platform" from "user cancelled" (both
    would otherwise look like an empty result) -- Windows/Linux stub returns `false`/
    `nullopt` rather than untested `IFileOpenDialog`/`GtkFileChooserNative` code with no
    way to verify it here.
  - **BUILT (Phase 1)**: `EditorBridge::openFile()`'s body refactored into a shared
    private `openFileAtPath()`, reused by both the pre-existing `openFile(path)` (JS
    supplies the path -- still not wired to any UI control) and the new
    `openFileDialog()` (no args, calls `kronos::showOpenFileDialog()` then the same
    helper). Bound in `main.cpp`, and `pane.js` gets an "Open..." button next to each
    pane's dataset-select (opens into that specific pane, mirroring drag-and-drop).
    `mock_bridge.js` mirrors it with a `window.prompt()` stand-in, same spirit as its
    existing fabricated-data approach.
  - **Save dialog built but deliberately not wired to any UI yet**: `showSaveFileDialog()`
    exists (same mechanism, proven once Open works) but nothing calls it -- there's
    nothing meaningful to write yet. `moveEntry`/`copyEntry`/`setComment` only mutate the
    in-memory `setlists_` structs, never `data_` (no `putRecordBytes()`/encoder exists).
    Wiring a Save button now would either silently discard every edit (writing back
    unmodified original bytes) or need to be disabled/misleading -- worse than waiting.
  - **CONFIRMED WORKING in the real app (2026-08-03)**: the `runModal` fix does resolve
    the z-order bug -- the panel appears in front and a dataset loads successfully via
    "Open...". Blind Spot #11 updated accordingly. This was the actual gate for
    everything below.
  - **Drag-and-drop-to-open REMOVED (2026-08-03), now that "Open..." works**: the
    file-drop listeners (`dragenter`/`dragover`/`dragleave`/`drop` for *files*, as
    opposed to the still-present Setlist row drag-and-drop, which is unrelated and
    untouched) are gone from `pane.js`, along with `arrayBufferToBase64()`, the
    `EditorBridge::openFileBytes()` bridge method, its `main.cpp` binding, and the
    hand-rolled `decodeBase64()` helper -- all fully unreachable once "Open..." is the
    only way in, removed rather than left as dead code (per this project's usual
    convention). `mock_bridge.js`'s fake `openFileBytes` removed too; its
    no-native-bridge-detected check now looks for `window.openFileDialog` instead.
    `.pane.drag-over` (and the now-pointless `border: 2px dashed transparent` on `.pane`
    that only existed to support it) removed from `style.css`. The `.view-hint` text and
    this bridge's own doc comments updated to stop describing a mechanism that no longer
    exists.
  - **Can't open the same dataset twice (BUILT 2026-08-03)**: `openFileAtPath()` now
    checks `m_datasets` for an existing entry whose `displayName` (which, for every path-
    based open, *is* the real path) exactly matches before loading anything -- if found,
    returns that dataset's existing info (`alreadyOpen: true`) instead of loading a
    second redundant copy. This was only feasible once every open went through a real,
    stable path (drag-and-drop never had one to compare against, which is exactly why
    this wasn't attempted before). `pane.js` logs a distinct "already open" message when
    this happens, but otherwise needs no special handling -- `loadDataset()` just shows
    whichever `datasetId` came back either way. `finishOpen()` and this new check share
    a `datasetResultValue()` helper so the `{datasetId, displayName, setlistCount}` shape
    is built in exactly one place.
  - **Verified**: compiles and links clean (confirms `choc::objc` + the existing
    `-framework Cocoa`/`-framework WebKit` link flags are sufficient, no new link step
    needed), app launches without crashing, `ctest` unaffected (no `PcgFile`/decoder
    changes in Phase 1), all JS syntax-checked, a full grep swept for any leftover
    reference to the removed drag-and-drop/`openFileBytes` code (none found).
  - **"Open..." moved from per-pane to a single topbar button (2026-08-03,
    frontend-only, no C++ changes)**: opening a dataset was never really "for" a
    specific pane (a dataset is decoupled from panes -- see `EditorBridge.h`), so having
    two identical buttons was redundant. `index.html`'s `.topbar` now holds the one
    `.open-file-button` (left side, `h1` flows after it) plus a `.topbar-loading`
    spinner; `pane.js`'s per-pane button/spinner markup and click handler are gone,
    replaced by two small exports (`loadDataset`, `isEmpty`) that `app.js`'s new global
    click handler uses to land a freshly-opened dataset in the first empty pane (A
    checked before B); if both panes already show something, the dataset still becomes
    selectable from either dropdown via the usual `refreshDatasets()` broadcast, just
    not auto-shown. The same-path dedup (`alreadyOpen`) already existed in
    `EditorBridge::openFileAtPath()` from the change above -- confusion about "still
    being able to open the same file twice" turned out to be testing against a stale
    already-running process (native code had changed but the process hadn't been
    relaunched), not a real gap; `mock_bridge.js`'s fake `openFileDialog()` now mirrors
    the same dedup-by-displayName behavior for consistency in plain-browser mode.
    `datasets.js`'s `populateDatasetSelect()` now labels each option `#<id> — <full
    path>` instead of just the bare path, so the id and the complete name are both
    always visible, not just whichever was picked out via truncation/CSS ellipsis.
  - **Phase 2, designed but not built -- only once Phase 1's dialog fix is confirmed
    working**: chunked reading with real progress, reported natively -- `PcgFile::load()`
    gains an optional `std::function<void(size_t,size_t)>` progress callback (seek for
    total size upfront, read in fixed chunks, e.g. 4MB, invoking the callback after
    each). The read runs on a background `std::thread` (so it can't block the WebView);
    progress and the final result both cross back to the main thread via
    `choc::messageloop::postMessage()` (confirmed thread-safe for exactly this use, see
    `choc_MessageLoop.h:67`), which then calls `WebView::evaluateJavascript()` to push a
    `window.__onImportProgress(percent)` / `window.__onImportComplete(result)` call into
    the page -- the first *native-initiated* event this bridge will have used, versus
    every existing method's JS-initiated request/response shape. Only the final
    `m_datasets` insert happens on the main thread -- the read/parse itself touches no
    shared state, so it's safe to run in the background. `openFileDialog()`'s bound call
    becomes fire-and-forget (returns immediately once a path is chosen) rather than
    blocking for the whole read. This is *not* built yet.

--- BLIND SPOTS / NOT YET TOUCHED ---

Format:
  1. SBK1 +17's bit3 and bits0-2 -- still unexplained now that bit4 and
     bits5-7 are confirmed as Font size/Transpose (see above). Real files
     show isolated non-zero values there independent of either confirmed
     field, so something real is still unaccounted for.
  2. What the `used`/count header field (present in SDB1/SBK1/CBK1/MBK1/
     PBK1 alike) actually counts.
  3. The 4-byte prefix field preceding every chunk header throughout the
     whole format.
  4. Exactly which of the 20 PRG1 banks maps to which display label --
     lookup mechanism confirmed, specific label-per-index is not.
  5. DKT1 (Drum Kits), WSQ1 (Wave Sequences), GLB1, DPI1 -- entirely
     unexplored. Unknown whether Set List slots can reference these
     directly (if so, instrument-name lookup has a gap there too).
  6. The older SoundQuest `.SQS` backup dialect (`LIST`/`FORM`/`BANK`
     wrapping) found under `~/Documents/Sound Quest/` -- structurally
     different from the `KORG`/`PCG1` dialect this parser targets; never
     tested against it.
  7. **UNCONFIRMED (project owner's own recollection, 2026-08-07, not yet
     independently tested by this project)**: a Set List slot's NAME (SDB1,
     the 24-byte field distinct from SBK1's Comment) must be a single line
     -- no embedded line breaks -- and names longer than 24 characters get
     truncated to fit on the real device. The 24-character figure matches
     this project's own already-confirmed byte layout exactly
     (`kRecordSize`(28) - `kMarkerSize`(4) = 24 bytes, see `PcgFile.cpp`'s
     `readRecordName()`), which is a good consistency sign, but the actual
     *behavior* on real hardware -- silent truncation vs. some other
     handling when a user types past the limit -- hasn't been checked.
  8. **UNCONFIRMED (same source/date as #7)**: the Comment field truncates
     after 512 characters on the real device. Doesn't cleanly match this
     project's own confirmed byte math: SBK1's Comment field spans
     `RECORD_SIZE`(542) - `COMMENT_OFFSET`(18) = 524 bytes, minus 1 for the
     NUL terminator (`setlist-comment.js`'s `encodeSetlistComment()` already
     enforces this exact `RECORD_SIZE - COMMENT_OFFSET - 1` = 523-byte cap)
     -- an 11-byte gap between the recalled 512 and the byte-derived 523
     worth resolving: either the real device enforces a tighter UI-level
     limit than the byte layout technically allows, or one of these two
     numbers is slightly off (a rounded recollection vs. an exact byte
     count). Not yet reconciled -- needs an isolated real-hardware test
     (e.g. write exactly 512 and exactly 523 ASCII characters via this
     project's own write path, see what the device actually shows/accepts)
     before either number goes in `docs/README.md` as confirmed.
  9. **NEWLY SURFACED, 2026-08-07, while building the Internals pane (see
     "ARCHITECTURE" below)**: every Program/Combi bank "index" this project uses
     anywhere (`ProgramInfo::bank`, `programBankTypes()`, the whole Programs/
     Combis tables, Timbre cross-referencing, `copyProgramFrom()`'s destination
     checks -- literally everywhere) is actually just that bank's POSITION among
     however many PRG1/CBK1 sub-bank chunks were found, in file order --
     `PcgFile.cpp`'s PRG1-parsing loop assigns `bankIdx` purely as a loop
     counter, with no reference to any per-chunk identity field. This has been
     silently correct so far only because every real file examined happened to
     contain a complete, canonically-ordered set of banks. The project owner's
     own observation (saving a backup apparently lets you choose which data to
     include) means that assumption may not hold in general: a file missing,
     say, canonical bank 4 would silently relabel every later bank as one
     position earlier than its real identity, everywhere in this app, with no
     way currently to detect it. Directly related to blind spot #4 above (label-
     per-index confidence) and #2 (the `used`/count header field) -- and each
     PRG1/CBK1 sub-bank chunk's own first 4 bytes (currently read and discarded,
     "meaning not understood yet") are a real candidate for a per-chunk bank-
     identity field that would fix this properly. Not yet investigated with
     real test data that's actually missing a known bank -- the Internals pane
     surfaces the current (possibly wrong, if anything's missing) file-order
     numbering honestly rather than hiding the uncertainty.
     **Confirmed directly, 2026-08-07** (real hardware behavior, see
     `docs/README.md` §5/§5.2): engine assignment (HD-1/EXi) is a global,
     per-bank setting -- a bank can never mix engines -- and bank storage is
     all-or-nothing, always exactly 128 slots, never partial. This doesn't
     resolve the file-order-vs-identity gap above, but it does sharpen it: a
     "missing bank" can only mean a whole PRG1/CBK1 sub-bank chunk absent
     entirely, never a partially-saved or mixed-engine one -- so whatever
     eventually identifies a bank properly (e.g. the unexplored first-4-bytes
     field above) only ever has to answer a binary present/absent question
     per bank, not a "how much of it is there" one.

App/UI:
  8. Leading spaces reportedly disappearing from Comment text somewhere in
     the round-trip -- reported once, not yet reproduced. Neither
     `readComment()` nor `setComment()` does any trimming, so the cause
     isn't obvious from code inspection alone; repro steps needed (typed
     fresh via Apply vs. already present in the source file).
  9. **First piece BUILT 2026-08-06; real-hardware round-trip CONFIRMED the same
     day for a minimal file** -- still real gaps remain, see below.
     `PcgFile::save()`/`EditorBridge::saveFileAs()` (see "ARCHITECTURE" above)
     write the retained bytes straight to disk -- a naive verbatim `data_`
     dump, no Save UI wired up (no dialog, no dirty-tracking). The project
     owner's actual bar was higher than "this app can re-open the file":
     loading it back onto real hardware -- **confirmed working**: a file
     generated by `tools/generate_setlist_test_matrix.{js,cpp}` (a minimal
     SDB1/SBK1-only file, one real entry plus 20 generated test slots) loaded
     onto a real Kronos with no issues, and every generated slot (Comment/
     Color/Volume/Font size, plus the Group 4 word-wrap probe) read back
     exactly as written -- see the "ARCHITECTURE" entry above for the full
     wrap-point results. This is real evidence the naive verbatim dump is
     hardware-acceptable, not just accepted by this app's own reader.
     **Still open**: this was only tested against a minimal file with no
     PRG1/CMB1/etc. content -- a full real backup (this app's actual primary
     use case) round-tripped through load-edit-save hasn't been checked yet,
     and the file-header checksum flag (§1.1, byte offset 8, confirmed
     present as `0x01` on the one real sample checked so far, but where any
     such checksum would actually live and over what byte range is still
     completely uninvestigated, see Format blind spot list above) remains a
     real question mark for a larger/more complex file even though this
     minimal one worked.
  10. Filter/search and row drag-swap/drag-copy interactions have been
      exercised by the project owner in the real app for file-open and
      name-lookup verification, but not explicitly confirmed end-to-end
      for the swap/copy drag gestures themselves or the Set List picker
      dropdown -- worth a deliberate pass.
  11. **RESOLVED (2026-08-03)**: the NSOpenPanel-behind-the-window bug was
      specifically in CHOC's own WebView-triggered delegate
      (`beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:`, a *sheet* attached to
      the WKWebView's window). `src/platform/NativeFileDialog.cpp` (see the
      NATIVE FILE DIALOG + PROGRESS section) calls `NSOpenPanel`/
      `NSSavePanel` directly via `runModal` -- app-modal, not sheet-attached,
      a genuinely different code path -- bypassing that delegate entirely.
      **Confirmed working in the real app**: the panel appears in front and
      loads a dataset successfully. Drag-and-drop-to-open has since been
      removed now that this is fixed -- "Open..." is the only way to load a
      file. Save dialog exists at the native layer but isn't wired to any
      UI yet (nothing meaningful to write -- no encoder exists).
  12. The sibling reference CHOC project (conventions, CI pipeline) still
      not linked in -- this scaffold's choices (no Bootstrap, plain CSS,
      specific file-open pattern) may get reconciled once it is.
  13. (resolved) CI now exists: `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` (docs site)
      and `.github/workflows/native-build.yml` (macOS arm64/Intel, Linux,
      Windows, path-filtered to skip docs/frontend-only pushes).
  14. **RESOLVED (2026-08-01)**: committed test infrastructure now exists
      on both sides. C++: `tests/pcg_file_test.cpp` + a scoped
      `pcg_file_test` CMake/`ctest` target, depending on *only*
      `PcgFile.cpp`/`ProgramDecoder.cpp`/`CombiDecoder.cpp` (not
      `main.cpp`/`EditorBridge.cpp`/CHOC) -- builds a small synthetic
      `.PCG` byte buffer in memory
      (real files are large and `.gitignore`'d) exercising
      `loadFromMemory()` end-to-end: Set List names, masked Font
      size/Transpose decoding (including deliberately-poked garbage bits
      in fields it doesn't own), Program bank cross-referencing,
      `findDuplicatePrograms()`, `programSetlistUsages()`, and
      `decodeProgram()`'s on-demand re-decode; extended same-day to cover
      the new Combi decoder too (`decodeCombiFields()` directly, plus
      `combis()`/`decodeCombi()` through a synthetic CBK1 bank). Runs via
      plain `ctest` in ~0.01s. Frontend: `setlist-comment.js` now has a headless,
      `node`-runnable `setlist-comment.test.js` alongside its existing
      `.test.html` browser harness, both importing the same real-byte
      fixture from a new shared `frontend/components/kronos/
      test-fixtures.js` (so they can't drift into testing different
      data) -- exits non-zero on any failed assertion, the shape
      CI/`ctest`-style automation needs. (A `frontend/components/
      package.json` with `"type": "module"` was also added -- without it
      Node mis-parses genuine ES module `export`/`import` syntax in a
      bare `.js` file and throws a confusing "does not provide an
      export" error.) Both suites were spot-checked with a deliberately
      broken assertion to confirm they fail loudly and non-zero, not just
      pass trivially. Next: proceed to the Combi decoder, per the
      already-agreed sequencing.
  15. **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (2026-08-03)**: an indeterminate spinner now covers
      the pane while a dropped file's base64-encode/decode+parse is in
      flight (see the EXPLORATION section's per-pane UI notes) -- still not
      a real percentage bar, which needs the encode/transfer restructured
      into chunks with progress callbacks rather than one monolithic step,
      not done.
  16. **RESOLVED (2026-08-01)**: the Library view has now been clicked
      through end to end in the real app (see the Datasets entry in
      "ARCHITECTURE" above) -- confirmed working.
  17. **RESOLVED (2026-08-02)**: drag-and-drop file loading -- a pane (or
      its sibling, if the drag passed over it on the way to the actual drop
      target) could stay visually marked as a drop target after a dataset
      had already loaded. Root cause confirmed as hypothesized: `pane.js`'s
      old `dragleave` handler only cleared the highlight when `ev.target
      === root`, but dragenter/dragleave fire per-element as the pointer
      crosses into/out of *child* elements too (the table, the
      dataset-select), so a `dragleave` targeting a child rather than
      `root` itself left the class stuck. Fixed with the standard
      enter/leave depth counter (immune to which descendant the event
      targets), plus every pane's highlight is now explicitly cleared in
      the `drop` handler (not just the pane that received the drop) to
      cover the sibling-pane case directly, regardless of exact event
      delivery order for a given drag session.
  18. **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (2026-08-08)**: Library's Duplicates tab showed
      "n/a" for a duplicate Program's Combi reference count -- noticed
      during an earlier click-through, and confirmed NOT a bug: reading
      `EditorBridge::findDuplicatePrograms()` showed no logic difference
      from the Programs tab's (also gated on
      `isConfirmedTimbreProgramBank(program.bank)`), and real duplicate
      Programs (often "Init Program"-style placeholders) do tend to sit
      outside the confirmed range -- the honest "don't know" case working
      as designed. Since then, the confirmed range itself was widened (see
      the ARCHITECTURE entry below) from INT-A..D (4 banks) to 8 banks
      total (INT-A..D plus USER-A/D/F/AA), using ground truth
      (docs/README.md §6.2) that was already independently confirmed but
      not yet wired into the Combi-usage-counting logic. **Still open**:
      every bank beyond those 8 remains genuinely unconfirmed, so "n/a"
      for a duplicate in, say, INT-E or USER-B is still correct, honest
      behavior, not a bug -- if a duplicate group ever shows "n/a" for a
      Program in one of the now-8 confirmed banks, that would indicate a
      real, distinct bug worth re-investigating.
  19. **Cosmetic, low-priority, unconfirmed**: possible padding-top
      inconsistency in the Internals pane (2026-08-08) -- the project
      owner reported the "Top-level chunks" topic's `.internals-chunk-row`
      shows the `padding-top: 8px` gap under its topic-row title
      correctly, but wasn't sure whether "Program banks"/"Combi banks"
      (`.internals-bank-groups`, same CSS property, same mechanism) show
      the same gap. Code inspection found no structural reason the two
      would differ, and this was folded into a broader debugging thread
      that turned up a real, confirmed, separate bug in the same report
      (`.internals-empty[hidden]` losing to Bulma's `.help{display:block}`,
      see App/UI blind spot list resolution history and `style.css`) --
      that real bug was fixed; this specific padding question was
